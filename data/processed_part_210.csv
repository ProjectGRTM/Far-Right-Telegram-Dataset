msg_iteration.1731.user.vinniesullivan.post.29679,1197278601,vinniesullivan,29679,,"Thoughts of a profound and astute nature come to some far easier than others. One particular activity that seems to conquer many creative thoughts within myself is the appreciation and observation various types of art. By staring at many paintings, illustrations and sculptures in the same fashion our ancestor's did, I find a flow of thought that might not have otherwise occurred. In fact, I sometimes find the inspiration induced by partaking in such stimulus can often create far too high a volume of thought for one to even keep up with. In the same way, I find observing society as if one is somehow removed, is the same as the observation of a grand, troublesome, forever changing painting that screams at us to make sense of its abnormality. There are many creative minds who simply haven't taken the time to adapt their wasted skills, or to even admit their own capabilities of doing so. The development of such skills begin when one directs the majority of one's cognitive effort that is usually saved for the workplace or one's favourite hobby, to the simple process of thought itself. I could give a million examples as to how the development of one's inner creativity works, but that's just how it applies to me. Those who willingly or unwillingly misunderstand what I'm saying, fear not, you're doing exactly as I'd expect of you already. However, If my words resonate with you, then your mind suggests that you're either one of the few, or, one of the few who've yet to join us.",2024-06-08 11:45:17+00:00,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/29679,,,1549,0,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They can harass & threaten me & my family. They can beat & torment me as you can see in the image below in 2010. They can lie in everywhere possible. They can take everything away from me. The price of resisting their tyranny, genocide & ethnic cleansing. But I will not bow. I am combat vet, have seen hell and that is why I have lost everything to fight for justice & truth. I have been resisting for decades what people are now finally resisting globally. And I am but one man and that is why the fear me and by extension, YOU. You have more power than you realize. Their world is built upon lies and they must use billions of dollars of resources and international connections to stop you from resisting. My heart & soul is clean, God is my witness. God is the ultimate arbitrator of justice. The same goes to you all, for our lives are finite and we will all meet our maker. How many of you sleep soundly at night while injustices are perpetuated every single day? Innocence blown to bits by the IDF, while the Israeli's sit perched on their thrones beneath the ashes of their victims and gloat about genocide they inflict because their victims are not chosen. The WESTERN so called ""leaders"" commit treason DAILY. Selling out to foreign interests who then coerce you with threats and violence if you do not comply. The world sees it openly now as they sell out their own peoples future in real-time. Speak truth to power and reconcile your deeds before Judgment Day. As a marine, I swore an oath to solemnly swear that I would defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. And that is why, I will never stop fighting for the Palestinian people & their right to self-determination, including all those who fight for free speech & justice for ALL. I would NEVER kill myself. - Ken O'Keef",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My family had warehouse units on the border of #WestHam/#Stratford. In the yards existed tough strays who'd use our warehouses to give birth. Their lives are one of incredible hardship. I used to save as many litters as possible, even taking some of the kittens home. Before this experience I used to think I hated Cats, but upon years of helping them I realised what I hated most was suffering. Life is incredibly difficult even with others to comfort you. Without, it's barely even a life at all.

Men have a type of power that cannot be disputed, so I certainly won't take the greatest power women have. It's OK to be envious, it's OK to have desire, it's not OK to pretend we're some kind of robots without the will to compete. In this life, we only have our youth for so long. So, for me, depriving anyone of high confidence and their one chance to take pride seems more about myself than them. The system has ruined our people's minds, but the system does not own us, nor our bodies. Confidence derives from the freedom to create it. I feel many men have been so damaged by modern times, they oppose everything as opposed to the few things that need fixing. I for one, despite my love for all things common, admire the special. We're all born somewhat the same, therefore to be special derives from what we do, as well as what others don't. 🤝",2024-05-18 06:39:25+00:00,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/29207,,,608,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.2436.user.vinniesullivan.post.28697,1197278601,vinniesullivan,28697,,"The tale of #Medusa is in fact one of great tragedy. Medusa had been admired for her beauty within Athens, Greece. A person who was kind and obeyed the Greek gods of the time. Her love for 'Athena Goddess of War' led her to becoming the priestess of Athena’s temple, a role unimaginable by the standards of mono-theism. Men from far and wide would travel to gaze upon her beauty until she became a symbol of beauty itself. Medusa's beauty became so renowned it made Athena herself jealous. Poseidon 'God of the Sea' had been seeking Medusa's affection, but faced rejection due to her wanting to remain pure. Poseidon, eventually took Medusa by force, whilst Athena did nothing to protect her. Poseidon would rape Medusa and then leaver her stranded with her image in utter ruin. As Medusa was no longer pure, Athena used the excuse to curse Medusa for the sins she could have prevented. Medusa’s once beautiful hair, was turned into a head of venomous snakes. And to ensure no man may look upon her again, Medusa’s eyes, would turn those who looked at them to stone. Medusa couldn’t even look into anyone’s eyes, never mind seek some kind of comfort. Medusa was also unable to turn herself into stone, and so the men who once admired her, strove to end her life for glory. Medusa was forced to hide and fight off her attackers until Zeus 'King of Gods' ordered his son Perseus to behead what was now considered a monster. The injustice of this story is a great lesson of hardship and misfortune from the ancient world. Unlike many other stories or religious scripture, many tales of the 'Old Gods' are but ways to explain our fear and pain as opposed to a story with a just ending. For years the tale of Medusa seems to be told as a form of heroism as opposed to tragedy, but for those who know the full detail of this story, it's a touching tragedy of a woman, as opposed to the heroic victory of a man.",2024-04-26 12:13:57+00:00,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/28697,,,2835,0,36,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hope to hear and see more from Nathan and others like him in the future and may release a few clips as he was OK with it being recorded. Thank you all for the support. Be sure to seek out pie and mash shops as, like our pubs, they're worth saving. 🤝🍻 You Tube: https://youtu.be/TYxg4chacGY?si=M9lffvgeRlmaAz_M",2024-03-16 16:08:14+00:00,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/28092,,,1524,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,video/mp4,6.030447611901645e+18,172.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The philosophical terms of the Greeks started to make their way into Christian philosophy. Long-dead thinkers who happened to have any resemblances to Christianity in their writings found themselves adopted as unwitting ancestors in the tradition. The whiff of Christianity hung around Plato?

msg_iteration.3186.user.vinniesullivan.post.27706,1197278601,vinniesullivan,27706,,"The Bottle Inn is a 16th-century public house at Marshwood in Dorset, which hosted the World Nettle Eating Championship. It is a Grade II Listed Building. The building started life in 1585, as an ale house, being close to a church where people came to pay their tithes. It was named The Bottle Inn, some time late in the 18th century, when it became the first inn in the area to sell bottled beers. The Bottle Inn was purchased as a free house (not tied to any one brewery) in 1982 from Ushers Brewery by Michael and Pauline Brookes. In 2014, the public house won the CAMRA award for West Dorset pub of the year. The Bottle Inn hosted the annual World Nettle Eating Championships as part of a charity beer festival. Competitors are served 2-foot (0.61 m) long stalks of stinging nettles from which they pluck and eat the leaves. After an hour the bare stalks are measured and the winner is the competitor with the greatest accumulated length of nettles. The contest began in the late 1980's when two farmers argued over who had the longest stinging nettles in their field and evolved into the World Nettle Eating Championships when one of the farmers promised to eat any nettle which was longer than his. The championship has separate men’s and women’s sections and attracts competitors from as far afield as Canada and Australia. In June 2010 Sam Cunningham, a fishmonger from Somerset won the contest, after eating 74 feet (23 m) of nettles. In June 2014 Phillip Thorne, a chef from Colyton, Devon won the contest, after eating 80 feet (24 m) of nettles. In 2017 the Overall Champion was Jonathan Searle from Solihull who munched his way through 70 feet of nettles whilst the Women's Prize went to Kate Ribton of Stoke St Gregory, in Somerset, who got through 28 feet (8.5 m) of the plant. The pub closed its doors in 2020 and has been sat derelict since, it would be lovely to see this pub brought back to its former glory and opened again. 🇬🇧 @europeanvolk",2024-02-17 04:50:08+00:00,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/27706,,,585,0,0,1,PeerChannel,1851216503.0,europeanvolk,2024-02-16 09:19:25,2024-02-16,https://t.me/europeanvolk/3159,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You make fantastic posts but plaster imagery which is now illegal to post or hands power to the same state you're troubled by. I'd love to be able to share more of your work and will continue to share many across my channels. I wish I could share the thoughts and statements of many more who allow classic mistakes to cloud the use of their talents. It's easy to fed-post, it's just the 4-chan system we've seen for too long. The development of of the skills requited to tackle difficult issues require practice and far more than short term endorphin chasing. If you use racial slurs it's like saying c*** in an argument, it's the avoidance of explaining one's self, to learn all that's required to properly adress and answer serious issues must be practised. If you honestly can't understand that you make it harder for those across the western world to connect, I feel you're not taking things seriously enough and see it as a game. Those of us who aren't anonymous shouldn't have to avoid or be put at risk by those who are anonymous. To fed post with those who are public is to expect them to take the blame for the things you're hiding from. This is a polite appeal to those who own grat channels and those with much to say, to consider a new approach which represents us properly as opposed to the pattern we've seen fail for years. We must know how to deal with difficult topics and that doesn't happen without work. You can dislike or attack me for saying this if you must but I can't share your work, or work with you anyway, so by saying nothing it's more damaging, especially when there's so many who could be of far more use to everyone. Inside you know this to be the case, I respect those who act online how they would in a room, remembering professionalism and respect. Loving your own isn't the same as hating others. 🤝",2024-01-19 13:23:34+00:00,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/27375,,,8524,0,57,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The battle was fierce, and the west saxon army suffered heavy losses against the imposing Vikings. However, Æthelred, under major risk of being flanked by overwhelming Viking forces, decided to carry out a preemptive attack and led his men in a charge up hill. Soon battle eschewed and raged around a small thorn tree and, finally, the west saxons were victorious. Yet, Ashdown was a short-lived victory, as it was followed by two defeats, one at Basing and the other at Meretun. Luck worsened, as soon after Easter, which fell on 15 April that year, Æthelred died and was succeeded by his brother Alfred. Finally, although the location of Ashdown is not known, the battle is usually thought to have occurred at Kingstanding Hill, South Oxfordshire: a claim that is frequently disputed by other historians.",2024-01-08 06:06:29+00:00,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/27191,,,491,0,3,1,PeerChannel,2103186999.0,TheGeniocracy,2024-01-08 01:56:10,2024-01-08,https://t.me/TheGeniocracy/30,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the grandson of the deposed King James II, Charles was thought by many - especially Catholics, Scotsmen, and Irishmen - to be the true and legitimate claiment to the British throne. After being raised and educated in Italy, Charles, in 1744, travelled to France to take part in a planned invasion to restore the Stuart Monarchy under his father (James Francis Edward Stuart). When the French invasion fleet was partly wrecked by storms, Charles resolved to proceed to scotland after discussion with leading Jacobites. These talks resulted in Charles landing by ship on the west coast of Scotland, leading to the events that would start the Jacobite rising of 1745. Contrary to popular opinion, the early stages of the rising were all but in the favour of the Jacobites; with Charles' forces winning the crucial battles of Prestonpans (September 1745) and Falkirk Muir (January 1745). However, by April 1746, Charles' forces were defeated at the battle of Culloden, which effectively ended the Jacobite cause. While there were subsequent attempts, such as the planned French invasion in 1759, Charles was unable to restore the Stuart dynasty. With the Jacobite Cause lost, Charles continued his life in exile, living in France and later in Italy.

He was, like many great britions of the 19th century, born in India: Bombay, to be exact.

He also merits a prominent and everlasting place in the history of English poetry.

Bond's are created by togetherness through thick and thin, not convince and inconsistency. The ridiculous and pathetic excuses which take place will be remembered as unloving absence during our final day's.

The pub gave birth to a song made famous during a Victorian era of theatrical entertainment named 'Music Hall'. The song ""Down at the old Bull and Bush""which dates somewhere in the early 1910’s was sung by Florrie Forde and can still be found online or even purchased on vinyl today. ""Come, come, come and make eyes at me Down at the Old Bull and Bush, Come, come, drink some port wine with me, Down at the Old Bull and Bush, Hear the little German Band, Just let me hold your hand dear, Do, do come and have a drink or two Down at the Old Bull and Bush, Bush, Bush Come, come, come and make eyes at me"" I can tell you form listening to the song, its a charm and the thought of anything happening to this pub with such a memory attached it makes me shudder.",2023-11-03 13:24:53+00:00,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/25996,,,522,0,2,1,PeerChannel,1324639172.0,BritainsPubs,2023-11-03 13:24:47,2023-11-03,https://t.me/BritainsPubs/1157,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,video/mp4,5.92016774239198e+18,180.094,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I provided them with evidence about Harvey milk being a paedophile and lots of worrying things about the LGBT cult and I'm happy to report they will no longer be teaching this to the kids.

msg_iteration.5381.user.vinniesullivan.post.24565,1197278601,vinniesullivan,24565,,"The True Story of the Cragg Vale Coiners. Up in Yorkshire in the 1760s, the industrial revolution was steaming ahead at full pelt. The rich were getting richer, through the building of cotton mills and factories, while the poor grew poorer. Suffering ensued. There was great poverty, especially in the area of Cragg Vale, near Hebden Bridge, which was populated by weavers, land-workers and their families. A man named David Hartley – known as “King David”, and played by Socha – came up with a Robin-Hood-esque idea: he would lead a gang of people who would counterfeit coins to bring money back to their community. His idea was to get coins locally from crooked officials, shop owners or publicans, then smelt the original metals with base ores. This could be done by what was known as ‘clipping’: shaving the edges off coins and milling them, meaning the original coins were imperceptibly smaller, while the offcuts could then be used to make new counterfeit coins, some of which were European, that then had the official designs stamped onto them. These coins were then placed back into circulation, and, according to the Yorkshire Examiner: “By the end of the 1760s, approximately £3.5m (£515m in today's money) of Coiner-forged coins had been paid into the Bank of England. The effect on the British economy was disastrous, devaluing the Pound by 9 percent.” The scheme continued successfully for almost 10 years, as the moors and vales of Cragg Vale were a relatively isolated place compared to the bigger cities in England. Clipping was a treasonous offence punishable by death and by 1769, rumours began circulating in parliament about a group committing fraud in Yorkshire. A public official, William Dighton, was put on to the gang of coiners, which now numbered about 80 people. One of the counterfeit coiners, James Broadbent, betrayed the group and gave evidence that revealed the conspirators in exchange for leniency of his own crimes. Dighton then arrested Hartley, which enraged his brother, Isaac. He rallied a gang of men who conspired to kill Broadbent (and in probably one of the earliest forms of crowdsourcing, raised 100 guineas from people who supported the plan) and on 10 November, 1769, two farm workers, Matthew Normanton and Robert Thomas, fatally shot Broadbent. The punishment The Marquess of Rockingham (and also former Prime Minister) Charles Watson-Wentworth was charged with finding the murderers, and by Christmas day of that same year, he had arrested 30 coiners. This is where The Gallows Pole name comes in: David Hartley was hanged at York Tyburn on April 28, 1770. Broadbent’s murderers were both hanged as well: Thomas on August 6, 1774 and Normanton on April 15, 1775. Hartley’s brother, Isaac, managed to escape, and lived until 1815.",2023-06-14 06:29:44+00:00,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/24565,,,464,0,2,1,PeerChannel,1671989371.0,forgottenhistoryuk,2023-06-14 05:43:03,2023-06-14,https://t.me/forgottenhistoryuk/10197,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I said that was actually the story I was covering. At this point, he informed me that this tale, which I knew happened in an old house in the village, happened in HIS house, and then he gave me some fascinating information and details about the story that I didn’t know. The house is also included in the video now too thanks to this encounter. Small details that would otherwise have been lost… now saved and soon to be brought to an ever growing audience.

They seek solutions in philosophy, self-help books and videos, and of course frauds, charlatans and grifters on YouTube and Twitter (not naming any names). But I believe that people have always learned best through stories and legends. For example, the Arthurian legends teach great lessons on adventure, masculinity and honour. Beowulf teaches us of courage, leadership and self-sacrifice. The Iliad, which Alexander kept a copy of under his pillow, is a true epic lesson of how despair and destruction go hand in hand with glory and heroism. MacBeth, Don Quixote, Lord of the Rings, and of course the stories of Cú Chulainn and Fionn mac Cumhaill. The Odyssey, King Lear, I could go on.

When these tracks come on, I sing along with them as if they're part of my mind, as if they define who and what I am. Sherwood has brought the wonder of our music back to life with his own very special touch. I'm moved and made creative by his work be I on the train or plotting a scene. These songs are in with the greatest artists on earth and I have no need to skip when one of my favourites comes on. I only wish I could repay Sherwood, for all he's given me through his music.

I don't say this because he is one of ours, I say this because I mean it... The voice of Merry England encourages me just as much as any other I listen to and hope it will do the same for you. When these tracks come on, I sing along with them as if they're part of my mind, as if they define who and what I am. Sherwood has brought the wonder of our music back to life with his own very special touch. I'm moved and made creative by his work be I on the train or plotting a scene. These songs are in with the greatest artists on earth and I have no need to skip when one of my favourites comes on. I only wish I could repay Sherwood, for all he's given me through his music. I'm lucky enough, to call him my friend.

I've seen so many personal trainers wasting people's time which can often lead the already insecure customer into further believing they'll never see improvement. For many financial gain dictates that it's not in their interest to genuinely help you though this obviously doesn't apply to all trainers or PT's. Many PT's would agree with me that there's a huge number of people who capitalise from the fact someone has risen the courage to improve, which I find particularly distasteful. Just as important are the huge number of people making great attempts to learn alone with rate of success and failure.

msg_iteration.6286.user.vinniesullivan.post.23178,1197278601,vinniesullivan,23178,,"Who was Gottfried Wilhelm Von Leibniz? Gottfried Wilhelm Von Leibniz (1646-1716) was a 17th century German polymath genius. A Mathematician, Philosopher, Physicist, Engineer, Inventor, Polyglot, diplomat, librarian and amongst other things an outstanding mind. Although his contributions to knowledge are far too numerous to name, he is best remembered for five great feats of genius: The discover of Calculus alongside Isaac Newton, the inventor of the first fully functional mechanical calculator, one of the main exponents of continental rationalism, the co-inventor with papin of the steam engine and the discoverer of binary code (the language of computers). However, due to disputes with Newton concerning his discovery of calculus, Leibniz was subject to much unfair accusation and abuse. As such, he published very little of his brilliance and preferred to write letters to the leading intellectual figures of his day, alongside private manuscripts. His total works have yet to be fully categorised, translated and published. Due to these lifelong inconveniences, Leibniz lived the life of a diplomat and at times that of a librarian and Engineer. Although, he always remained a lifelong optimist; an optimist that believed in the ability of reason to help humanity thrive and grow. His greatest ambition, and for sure a result of his extreme optimism, was to construct what he called an “Algebra of thought” whereby all theoretical disputes could be solved computationally, given that the metaphysical code was right of course. Yet, despite this great dream never being completely fulfilled; Leibniz like always stayed optimistic for the future. Believing that: “This language will be the greatest instrument of reason,” for “when there are disputes among persons, we can simply say: Let us calculate, without further ado, and see who is right”. I hope too that he was right, yet only time will tell. Yet alongside these contributions, the blueprinting of energy efficient windmills, water pumps, mine shafts, even a submarine! Like many a great genius Leibniz, rather tragically, never got near the reception and admiration that he so rightfully deserved and at the age of 70 died poor and abandoned in his Hanover apartment. With his remains treated akin to that of a pauper, unmarked and uncharted for. Due to the harsh satirisation by Voltaire in Candide, few payed Leibniz the time of day. One can only speculate as to how advanced society would have been if his genius was truly given the time of day that it so rightfully deserved. Even now, scholars discover and analyse his magnificent writings with astonishment and excitement. This brief description only touches the iceberg of this profound thinker. The following posts will hopefully do more justice to such a great man. Yet I’ll leave you with this quote from Diderot: “When you return to yourself and compare the talents you received with those of Leibniz, you’re tempted to throw the books away and quietly die into some hidden corner of the world.”",2023-02-15 18:20:36+00:00,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/23178,,,644,0,0,1,PeerChannel,1832696569.0,LeibnizVision,2023-02-15 18:14:10,2023-02-15,https://t.me/LeibnizVision/4,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.6442.user.vinniesullivan.post.22916,1197278601,vinniesullivan,22916,,"The distinctions of knowledges: the fallacy of logical Mysticism In concerning the distinction and differentiation of different knowledges, we must by reason categorise the organisations in which the mind orders rational and empirical thought. As is mostly commonly agreed upon in epistemology, the synthetic-analytic distinction as developed by Kant shall be used to analytically order the categories of knowledge. Analytic a priori statements: this form of knowledge refers to statements that prove themselves without the need of external evidence. As such, this division is reverent to knowledges that is completely logical and tautological: Logic, Mathematics and self referential statements I.e “all bachelors are unmarried men” are sound exemplars. Hence, this knowledge requires only pure reason to express its self, even if the semantic knowledge requires external experience. Yet this knowledge is restricted in its heuristic ability to verify empirical data. Synthetic a posterior statements: this form of knowledge refers to statements that form a resolute relation between two or more distinct and external factors I.e “It is raining outside”, nothing about ‘outside’ predicates raining, hence requiring a posterior sense date to conceive logically via empirical inference. This form of knowledge constitutes any descriptive statements, and is the meta-logical basis for the sciences and inductive/statistical references. Its restriction lies with the problem of induction as stated by Hume. Analytic a posteriori statements: knowledge of this kind is logically impossible to express via reason and by extension, language its self. As no piece of logical or empirical reference can substantiate the claim that there are tautologous statements that describe the external world before experienced via sense perception. This ‘knowledge’ constitutes mysticism and spiritualism, and since violating the laws of logic and empirics it is by nature ineffable and nonsensical. However, as a means of clarification, this does not mean that said mystical or pure experience does not ‘exist’, merely said reference is beyond rational discussion and hence should be reserved to individual experience. Yet no intellectual breadth should be given to such illogic. Anyone that claims a position of “beyond logic” is merely contradicting themselves via the use of language, which is but a semantic reasoning and hence a logic. As by logical necessity, one cannot use a system to prove another distinct system; not inherently that is.",2023-01-20 17:01:25+00:00,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/22916,,,533,0,1,1,PeerChannel,1732165756.0,TheAthenaeumEC,2023-01-18 13:10:20,2023-01-18,https://t.me/TheAthenaeumEC/241,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The child with his primer sets out alone And speeds as if he were hunted, The wind goes by with a hollow moan-- There's a noise in the hedge-row stunted. 'Tis the turf-digger's ghost, near-by he dwells, And for drink his master's turf he sells. ""Whoo! whoo!"" comes a sound like a stray cow's groan; The poor boy's courage is daunted. Then stumps loom up beside the ditch, Uncannily nod the bushes, The boy running on, each nerve a twitch, Through a jungle of spear-grass pushes. And where it trickles and crackles apace Is the Spinner's unholy hiding-place, The home of the cursèd Spinning-witch Who turns her wheel 'mid the rushes. On, ever on, goes the fearsome rout, In pursuit through that region fenny, At each wild stride the bubbles burst out, And the sounds from beneath are many. Until at length from the midst of the din Comes the squeak of a spectral violin, That must be the rascally fiddler lout Who ran off with the bridal penny! The turf splits open, and from the hole Bursts forth an unhappy sighing, ""Alas, alas, for my wretched soul!"" 'Tis poor damned Margaret crying! The lad he leaps like a wounded deer, And were not his guardian angel near Some digger might find in a marshy knoll Where his little bleached bones were lying. But the ground grows firmer beneath his feet, And there from over the meadow A lamp is flickering homely-sweet; The boy at the edge of the shadow Looks back as he pauses to take his breath, And in his glance is the fear of death.

Take up the White Man's burden - In patience to abide To veil the threat of terror And check the show of pride; By open speech and simple, An hundred times made plain, To seek another's profit, And work another's gain. Take up the White Man's burden - The savage wars of peace - Fill full the mouth of famine And bid the sickness cease; And when your goal is nearest The end for others sought, Watch Sloth and heathen Folly Bring all your hopes to nought. Take up the White Man's burden - No tawdry rule of kings, But toil of serf and sweeper - The tale of common things. The ports ye shall not enter, The roads ye shall not tread, Go make them with your living, And mark them with your dead ! Take up the White Man's burden - And reap his old reward, The blame of those ye better, The hate of those ye guard - The cry of hosts ye humour (Ah slowly !) towards the light:- ""Why brought ye us from bondage, ""Our loved Egyptian night ?"" Take up the White Man's burden - Ye dare not stoop to less - Nor call too loud on Freedom To cloak your weariness; By all ye cry or whisper, By all ye leave or do, The silent sullen peoples Shall weigh your Gods and you. Take up the White Man's burden - Have done with childish days - The lightly proffered laurel, The easy, ungrudged praise. Comes now, to search your manhood Through all the thankless years, Cold-edged with dear-bought wisdom, The judgement of your peers.",2022-11-17 17:28:21+00:00,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/21755,,,470,0,6,1,PeerChannel,1366921559.0,VinsFavouriteArtwork,2022-11-17 17:20:44,2022-11-17,https://t.me/VinsFavouriteArtwork/3710,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Almost upon the western wave Rested the broad bright Sun; When that strange shape drove suddenly Betwixt us and the Sun. And straight the Sun was flecked with bars, (Heaven's Mother send us grace!) As if through a dungeon-grate he peered With broad and burning face. Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud) How fast she nears and nears! Are those her sails that glance in the Sun, Like restless gossameres? Are those her ribs through which the Sun Did peer, as through a grate? And is that Woman all her crew? Is that a DEATH? and are there two? Is DEATH that woman's mate? Her lips were red, her looks were free, Her locks were yellow as gold: Her skin was as white as leprosy, The Night-mare LIFE-IN-DEATH was she, Who thicks man's blood with cold. The naked hulk alongside came, And the twain were casting dice; 'The game is done! I've won! I've won!' Quoth she, and whistles thrice. - The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Samuel T.

A subject that has always remained dear and close, one to which I am most proficient and well versed in, yet rarely discuss in conversation: I am of course referring to mathematics, especially to its most sublime form, pure mathematics. To me and as to other great mathematicians, the subject is but the definition of pure reason, an abstract study that attempts to describe the facets of reality either by conceptualising abstract quantities from empirical finding (Applied) or from rationalised axioms (Pure). As such, mathematics is more then mere counting, and consists of four main topic areas and one Meta-Mathematical area. These being as follows: numbers (arithmetic and number theory), formulas and related structure (geometry and or topology), and quantities and their changes ( Calculus and analysis). With meta-mathematics consisting of Logic and set theory that attempt to solve, prove and deduce the axiomatic and theoretical proofs of mathematics as whole. As such, the mathematician uses a variety of methods to prove, categorise and periodically stage the steps of the branches. With mathematical proofs serving as the Pure staging of deductive rules from previous axioms, formulas or sequences to further construct wider rules of concerning abstract concepts: example being Euler’s Identity. While mathematical models serve as the applied staging of theories constructed around empirically backed data used most often in: physics, statistics,economics, finance,psychology and etc. Example: The motion equations that describe the prescribed movement and temporal displacement and distances of a moved object in a plane.

Also called a morning gown, robe de chambre or nightgown, the banyan was a loose, T-shaped gown or kimono-like garment, made of cotton, linen, or silk and worn at home as a sort of dressing gown or informal coat over the shirt and breeches. The typical banyan was cut en chemise, with the sleeves and body cut as one piece. It was usually paired with a soft, turban-like cap worn in place of the formal periwig. An alternative style of banyan was cut like a coat, fitted, with set-in sleeves, and was closed with buttons and buttonholes. https://t.me/TheAthenaeumTRR",2022-10-28 08:51:23+00:00,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/21343,,,488,0,4,1,PeerChannel,1732165756.0,TheAthenaeumEC,2022-10-28 08:48:51,2022-10-28,https://t.me/TheAthenaeumEC/92,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have no bodies, no tombs, no physical remains, no letters, no engravings—nothing that counts as evidence. The oldest existing Bible dates from the year 350; as we move backward in time from there, our confidence in the actual text diminishes significantly. Expert consensus is that the four Gospels date to the years 70 to 95 AD, and Paul’s letters to 50 to 70 AD. Between the years zero and 93 AD we have absolutely no independent, corroborating evidence for such things as the Bethlehem star, any of Jesus’ 36 miracles, any of the apostles’ miracles, or any of the Christian-specific events depicted in the New Testament. Josephus’ brief reference in 93 is the first independent confirmation of the mere existence of a Christian movement, followed by Tacitus and Pliny around the year 115. ----- From: The Jesus Hoax by David Skrbina. @ChristianityExposed",2022-10-02 06:19:51+00:00,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/20974,,,723,0,7,1,PeerChannel,1683360915.0,ChristianityExposed,2022-10-01 08:44:12,2022-10-01,https://t.me/ChristianityExposed/243,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our televisions, apps and society itself are designed to waste our time on short term entertainment in which we learn nothing. The aim is to pass the peasants lifetime without them noticing the many wrongs in which they've been deliberately afflicted. Just try and pick some of those subjects you always meant to get around to instead of watching pointless shorts on You tube or a generic crime series. At first it may be boring, it may even seem morbid and depressing, but after a while the things you learn will make you question and seek so much more. Inside the reader knows this to be true as so many of us put off academic research for that which entertains us. If one can learn to find information entertaining, then the seed is sown for what will be a tree of knowledge. In time one will become engrossed from morning until night time, spending your train journeys and evenings fulfilling a need you've ignored for too long. I can't advertise history and it's difficulties as fun as we're all different but I can say it's a far more rewarding reality than I ever imagined.

Please consider joining us in both viewing and archiving the wonderful pubs we're losing. Even busy pubs will suffer and close at the hands of new energy bills and multiple cultural attacks which are very deliberate. Our series will continue on our other page but there's far too many to cover in a lifetime and they're disappearing at a rapid rate. Especially the pubs you see being either demolished or renovated, some pictures I've received show a pub just as the demolish crew have stepped in, making the image we have very last. Pubs aren't just places to drink they're the excuse we need to be among each other without needing to ask. They're the cultural places which carves our hearts and minds, today's regime to buy out and close pubs is to destroy the community and people who need them.

The epoch term ‘Enlightenment’ which is regularly prescribed to a variety of intellectual movements during the 17th and 18th century is but a subversive and highly inaccurate term that men of reason should stop using in historical discourse. As the large time span from the 1640’s to the 1820’s should lead people skeptical of such a broad-stroke term. For the simple reason that there were a variety of intellectual geniuses with different ideas and concepts, all of which cannot simply be characterised under such a term. For example, the apolitical reason based and mechanistic approach to science, mathematics and philosophy of Descartes, Newton and Leibniz cannot at all be grouped with with the politicised philosophy of Locke, Hobbes and Rousseau (all three of which cannot in themselves be characterised together). https://t.me/TheAthenaeumTRR",2022-07-26 15:30:47+00:00,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/19713,,,472,0,0,1,PeerChannel,1732165756.0,TheAthenaeumEC,2022-07-26 15:29:56,2022-07-26,https://t.me/TheAthenaeumEC/29,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Example: Galileo Galilei the Italian astronomer, physicist and philosopher that by using his experimental method located optically that the solar system was heliocentric, like the ancients eventually discovers. However said views were contrary to church theology and hence were prohibited and ridiculed: stage 1. Then as other astronomers such as Kepler and copernicus started to support said idea, it became criminalised: Stage 2. Then with the indisputable work of Isaac Newton in celestial mechanics,heliocentricism became the commonplace truth: stage 3. https://t.me/TheAthenaeumTRR",2022-07-25 03:40:11+00:00,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/19663,,,543,0,3,1,PeerChannel,1732165756.0,TheAthenaeumEC,2022-07-25 01:12:51,2022-07-25,https://t.me/TheAthenaeumEC/13,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It suspiciously began in a ""merchant"" area near Rome's chariot stadium. Interestingly Emperor Nero said the ""Christian"" community which had newly arrived were to blame. Like the Great fire of London where the ""Protestants"" blamed the ""Catholics"" when outsiders posing as Christians were most likely responsible. Christianity is an eastern theism which moved into Rome, keep this in mind when looking into the 'Great Fire of Rome, or the 'Great Fire of London'. Two thirds of Rome had been destroyed, much like other civilisations we never saw again. If one was to believe the mainstream narratives, then this was just another 'accident' resulting in the destruction of western brilliance.

In the next breath her partner Christopher Irons is claiming hes going to wait until im not in then come to my family home to cause trouble for my innocent wife. So once again threats towards my home and my family from people who claim to work with Northumbria Police More groups the Police have got their claws into #onceacopper #alwaysacopper United Survivors are butt hurt because I have evidence their lovely police force has been complicit on child abuse and they want to work with them Ailsa actually said to me ""we can't take the police down because we need to work with them"" This is after showing evidence of them complicit in child abuse Why are United Survivors covering up child abuse on behalf of Northumbria police? How much are you being paid for this Ailsa and Chris? I can assure you the statement says its from the ""United Survivors team"" I can assure you there is no team and this is Ailsa and Chris acting alone Another round of the shit show I wonder what Northumbria Police throw at me next week 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Truth will prevail, Justice will be Done ✔ 🙏 #iamleegarrett https://youtu.be/rzerhClm00U",2022-03-15 15:25:00+00:00,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/18148,,,790,0,2,1,PeerChannel,1450764128.0,iamleegarrett1,2022-03-15 10:49:05,2022-03-15,https://t.me/iamleegarrett1/11427,0,,,1,MessageMediaWebPage,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These songs are in with the greatest artists on earth and I have no need to skip when one of my favourites comes on. I only wish I could repay Sherwood, for all he's given me through his music.

Thus the self destructive, pointless nature of competitive posturing & trickery is as great a detriment to us as the issue's facing the western world. Too many miss traps set by outside deviants, interfering with connections that should flourish or at least improve as opposed to diminish. A difficult and important truth is that some mistakes and act's do pose a risk to the security of innocents and can't be ignored. To conclude the issue's we have, we mustn't be afraid to talk, especially when safety is concerned. There's a gargantuan effort being made right now by deviant entities to widen divides and create new arguments which needn't exist. Complete unison isn't a foreseeable reality, nor is it sensible. One group requires one successful infiltration to discredit or destroy all those involved, and some have better security than others. Different minds unbound by one set of guidelines must exist. Then these mind's can hopefulky meet somewhere in the middle. No false unison, but an understanding of each person's importance and sacrifice. The few among us aren't from Cambridge, Eton or a private Media college. Instead we've learnt on the spot out of hellbent necessity and what felt the only moral road to pursue. Are such people your enemy? Are they each other's enemy? Or are they a product of a sick world trying to heal itself? Think for yourself ____ We've no dwelling in our realm. We've no united house We're sown and strewn without room, With little to espouse We're instead each other's foe, We live for here and now. So new seeds may never sow, This we must avow. If only we'd align somehow, Care for more than now. We could feed a hungry seed, If only we'd allow. We could be so much more, We could have our Rome. Bond us not upon a house, But instead upon our home. ('Our Realm' —VS)",2022-01-30 20:24:44+00:00,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/17638,,,1727,0,12,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A wonderful and helpful ex-tour guide who works there gave us a walk through the pub and it's stunning features. This episode speaks of the class system of Victorian England and the methods used to keep the classes separated when in drinking venues. Snob screens can still be found in some British public houses since their use in the Victorian era. Usually installed in rows, they're made up of etched panes of glass in movable wooden frames. We had a wonderful day and deeply thank the staff at 'The Lamb' (Grade II listed pub at 94 Lamb's Conduit Street, Bloomsbury, London) and the kind reception we received. We cannot advise enough that you head down and enjoy this amazing location and take in it's inspiring history.",2022-01-05 08:52:37+00:00,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/17349,,,692,0,2,1,PeerChannel,1717848986.0,LostAndLivingPubs,2022-01-05 00:27:42,2022-01-05,https://t.me/LostAndLivingPubs/39,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,video/mp4,5.956120570029411e+18,1682.0,Episode_5_Snob_Screens_Britain's_lost_&_living_pubs_OdyseeEdition.mp4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I realised stimulation of the mind is vital to the development of creativity and an appreciation of the world we're lucky enough to have. I still remember where I was and what went through my mind, oh what a time. From then many more sound's which I discovered created many a vivid thought and idea which lead me to become the adult I am today.

Politics will be mentioned in relevant topics and historical features, not on a daily basis like I do now. Social media opinions do not find solutions but instead create problems.

The old man at the foot of the bed is Plato despite the fact he'd have been a young pupil of Socrates at the time. Socrates was know for saying “The only true wisdom is in knowing that you know nothing” in the face of the theists of the day. Meletus accused Socrates of atheism. Socrates is then said to have noted the contradiction between atheism and worshipping false gods in an effort to seek sense from his accusers. He's then said to have claimed that he is ""God's gift"" to the Athenians seeking freedom of thought & discussion. The jurors of his trial favoured the death penalty, which he accepted & lived out as bravely as he could for his followers. Here they surround him through his final moment's, many still argue over his death & the justifications made at for it.

Catholicism had decided to fight against outside interests, once it's founders lost control of what was in essence a tool for power. Those who once held the reigns of the Catholic church became replaced by those with national interest, thus making Catholicism a risk to Internationalist minds. He fought in the Eighty Years' War on the side of Catholic Spain against Protestant Dutch reformers who had 'outside' interests and backers. Like modern wars, histories facts are left to one side, hidden by false celebrations. Be it Poppies or Fireworks, reality plays no part in the world we know today. He went on to face a horrific execution for situations very few people understand or care for. Know what you celebrate, before you celebrate it.

(Segment from Bloody Sunday) William Morris (1834 – 1896) was an incredibly wealthy British born factory owner attributed as a great textile designer, poet, socialist activist and a huge name within the British Arts and Crafts Movement. In reality Morris was against private property for the people he claimed to speak for and ran the very capitalist cart which he claimed to tackle. Frederik Engles wished for Morris to become his own Karl Marx, but felt in the end he did not have what it took to play such a role, further highlighting Engles creation of Marx himself. The policies and lifestyle of William Morris were the opposite to his Communist diatribe, which has been preserved along with his art and properties. Born into comfortable wealth he became a member of the SDF and the Socialist League beside names such as Henry Hyndman and Eleanor Marx.

They too fought for the futures sake, Though we left them in the past. We left them each to rot alone, As if with a good enough reason. We claim a victory in their name. When what we did was treason Bothers and sisters slaughtered their own, They died in each others blood. No praise awaited their return Only a place in the mud Goodbye to the names lost for all time, Wherever and whoever you are, Be you on land or lost in the tide Be you at home or afar. Goodbye to each of those of you slain, Farewell to those who’ve departed. A memory too for the parents who, You left so broken hearted. We never ask why, we simply comply, We believe all the reasons we’re told. While we sit by, our people all die, Then find themselves left in the cold. So look upon our soldiers gone Like all that you adore Think of this very life you love, And the one's who live no more. Forget not their fate, or the murderous state, Embrace this one life and your health Forget not the lies that saw their demise, And remember to think for yourself. -Vinnie Sullivan 12/10/2021 Part 1 https://t.me/vinniesullivan/16429",2021-10-13 15:29:29+00:00,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/16430,,,2372,0,22,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msg_iteration.10311.user.vinniesullivan.post.16429,1197278601,vinniesullivan,16429,,"A Soldiers Grave (1/2) Beneath the ground, void of sound, The soldiers all now lay, Unknowing why, they had to die, Upon their final day. Their battle cries, filled the skies Fighting for what they believed, For good, for hope, for life and for love. Oh how they were deceived. Now they rest beneath the soil, Despite all hope and prayer. Unknowing why they really died, Unknowing why they're there. Our finest men, our fighting folk Built of our finest of stock. Some would die by knife and gun, Some with their back to a block The sea, the land, the sky itself. Each became death over life, So did end the lives of men, Which did so in struggle and strife. No peace for them, no long goodbye's, No notes or final say. A moments thought for all they loved, Before they fade away. Some still lay where they fell, Some graves are only a name An empty space in an empty row And each of them all look the same. Some may say, as together they lay, This is what they would choose. As brothers they rest among our best, With nothing at all left to loose. But I protest, I mourn their death, As a crime on each soul and the truth. They're far more, than a hole in the floor, Had they been old or in youth. The cenotaph sits so big and so proud, So far from the death and the cost. It shows not the faces of each of the slain, Nor the families to whom they were lost. Plaques, memorials, photo's and film. They each claim to speak for the dead, How many I wonder would have died for a lie, If it was truth that was upheld instead. Still they sit in their military pit, Some have done so for years, Each demise, forever closed eyes. Leaving much heartache and tears Pass now their graves and give them a glimpse, Read all the names that you can, There will be listed the year they were robbed, And the year in which they began. Give them a thought so somebody will, Ponder as to how they departed. Their life meant more than the reasons of war, With some over before they had started. The young they tore them self to shreds, In fear of their lives till the last They cried and stabbed and shot and fell, They died be it slow or it fast. They died all the same, no matter how kind No matter how brave or meek. From children to men, without knowing when, Lost all that made them unique. Those who tell the stories of war Do so in disguise and distain Lives are not a political tool, Nor are they financial gain. We'll never hear from those who've gone, Their voices are trapped in the past. If we could go back we'd change all that was, We'd stop every shot and blast. New rows stack upon themselves Though these stacks they never seem dirty. They list the age of so many lost, With so many under thirty. The teenagers rest beside the men, The young men rest there as well. I wonder what was on their mind, As they faced that murderous hell. Lieutenants, pilots, gunners and sergeants, Guard now the ground where they lay The sailor's, Parras, colonels and privates Act now as public display. From far and wide each was found, They meet for the first time in death. They felt so proud and duty bound, Until their very last breath. Lies have reigned for far too long, Affecting the minds of the pure, It’s illness plagues all of mankind, And often has no cure. There’s many who died with God on their side, Or so at least they thought, They instead met demise in utter surprise No matter how hard they fought. They're scattered across our nations, In graveyards far and wide, Even if you found each one, It’s a fraction of who died. No eye could see, the space they’d cover. For tens of miles they’d row The horizon itself would be blocked out By the numbers no-one would know. The unknown soldier rests beneath, His tiny cross-like stake His story’s gone and will never be told, Without even so much as a wake. Many exist alone somewhere, Their fate seemed sealed from the start. Emblems now sit on each of their graves, Suggesting they each played their part.

These episodes will vary from short to long with a range of historic topics crammed in each episode. A more informal style than some of our usual work, this series aim's to highlight the dying age of not only a the pub as we know it, but the drinking culture than once bound us as a community. The dying age of the pub represents the dramatic changes in society. The out-with-the-old and in-with-the-new mentality seems to apply to buildings and humans alike. Join us in this series as we uncover some of the wonderful buildings and locations which many may recognise from personal experiences, historical stories, or even from family references.

Safety engineer David poletski had quite the shock Monday morning when he turned up at mornington lane West London for an audition, only to find the audition was two decades ago. His double denim and tinted hair impressed absolutely no one, and ""90s Justin Timberlake"" style of singing was ""cringey"" at best.

msg_iteration.10521.user.vinniesullivan.post.16030,1197278601,vinniesullivan,16030,,"The origin of the ""37 gang"" by Luke uncaged IRVINE, Calif. — For 37 years, Exodus International was the leading beacon of the “ex gay” movement, which maintained that gay men and lesbians could change their sexual orientation through prayer and psychotherapy. But on the opening night of the group’s 38th annual conference here, Exodus International announced that the organization would disband, amid growing skepticism among its top officials and board members that sexual attractions can be changed. For the past year, the group’s president, Alan Chambers, has been increasingly vocal in proclaiming that therapy could not change a person’s sexual orientation. In a statement posted Wednesday on the group’s Web site, he cited a recent letter he had written to gay men and lesbians. “I am sorry for the pain and hurt many of you have experienced,” he said in the letter. “I am sorry that some of you spent years working through the shame and guilt you felt when your attractions didn’t change. I am sorry we promoted sexual orientation change efforts and reparative theories about sexual orientation that stigmatized parents.” In an interview on Thursday on the campus of Concordia University Irvine, Mr. Chambers said that he believed Exodus International had helped many Christians with same-sex attractions, including himself. But, he added: “Any good we could do in the future would be greatly overshadowed by the real stories of trauma and real stories of shame. So we decided, we can’t do anything but close this down. We can’t just change our name or change our mission.” The closing of Exodus International signals a major upheaval for the ex-gay movement, which has been the target of increasing criticism. Today, the 37 gang still honour the 37 years of hard work by naming themselves as such, and continue being ""very gay"" and behaving accordingly.

So the Scorpion jumps onto the Frogs back and they begin to cross. Hallway across the river, the Frog feels the killer blow of the Scorpians sting.

It is a philosophy of personal ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to eudaimonia (happiness, or blessedness) is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or by the fear of pain, by using one's mind to understand the world and to do one's part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and justly.""",2021-07-09 06:35:41+00:00,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/15020,,,1145,0,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What is it, that's become of the west? To which no valour is owed, or due. Where has gone, it's backbones strength? How did, such weakness break through? Where now beats, it's heart so strong? How did such darkness ensue? It seemed to change with time. Authenticity, like glory became taboo. History became the same as truth, Simple to misconstrue. It seemed to lose it's meaning among, An exclusive, privileged crew. As time did change, so did their tone, And all things they worked to undo. So lies became, like that of a plant. How tall they grew and grew. Those who tell them, water them well. Knowing the falsehoods they spew. I saw our glory hiding among faces. In the eyes of those, which always knew. In the moments of clarity and love and of hope, When we each know what we must do. I've felt it away from the stories and fables. Detached of the now and the new. Hidden miles from forced demoralisation. It was beautiful and it was true. So on I search for minds and for moments, The ones they can't subdue. I look now for others, who're as lost as I, Who'll respect the old and anew. So approaches the end of the day, Daylight will be my cue. I'll seek out the glory the west hides so well, So for now, I bid you adieu. —We Are Who We Are",2021-06-30 08:56:51+00:00,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/14923,,,764,0,5,1,PeerChannel,1197278601.0,vinniesullivan,2021-05-14 23:01:03,2021-05-14,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/14271,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the swell, the living hell, upon the deepest tomb. It doesn't care, for skulls and hulls, the his the hers and whom. It's stories tell, of a watery cell, with no bias but plenty of room. Encompassed by, a fickle sky, a realm that does die as does bloom. Out of helps reach, a life one can't teach, where death like vultures loom. Forget now the dry, no-one hears your cry, from a crypt no-one can exhume. Be it land you reach, or a bottomless beach, you had best sing along to it's tune. Amongst the frost, where hope is lost, a place one can never assume. It's nobodies home, though it's never alone, no creature is safe or immune. Where life is the cost, and all lines are crossed, at the whim of a watchful lagoon. It sits on a throne, and does so alone, with a ready and effective platoon. Lit up by stars, their lights become ours, a sight one can hardly consume. For a short time they glow, they put on a show, a sight which like life ends too soon. The rare light leaves scars, which bend our minds bars, whilst reflecting the tide from the moon. I guess now I know, why people go, where they risk either glory or doom. —Vinnie Sullivan",2021-06-03 15:07:58+00:00,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/14555,,,1166,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
