In ancient Egyptian architecture, gargoyles showed little variation, typically in the form of a lion's head. Similar lion-mouthed water spouts were also seen on Greek temples, carved or modelled in the marble or terracotta cymatium of the cornice. An excellent example of this are the 39 remaining lion-headed water spouts on the Temple of Zeus. Many medieval cathedrals included gargoyles and chimeras. According to French architect and author Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, himself one of the great producers of gargoyles in the 19th century, the earliest known medieval gargoyles appear on Laon Cathedral (c. 1200–1220). One of the more famous examples is the gargoyles of Notre-Dame de Paris.",2023-02-13 13:57:44+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/19437,,,539,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Perhaps, most impressive are studies that involve ibogaine treatment and short-acting opiates (such as heroin, oxycodone, morphine). Over and over again, these studies show that ibogaine can eliminate acute opiate withdrawal symptoms. A study published on ibogaine and substance users analyzed data on 75 people treated with ibogaine for cocaine, crack cocaine, and alcohol use during a 30-day program that incorporated psychotherapy. 61% of people treated remained abstinent one year later. Individuals who chose to ingest more ibogaine at a different time in the future, instead of a single administration model, were more likely to remain abstinent for longer. Lambarene today would be considered a microdose of ibogaine. Lambarene was withdrawn from the pharmaceutical market in 1966 after France declared ibogaine and the sale of ibogaine-containing products illegal. Before ibogaine was made illegal in the United States, the CIA knew ibogaine impacted drug dependency",2023-02-13 13:05:16+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/19436,,,592,0,12,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The uniqueness of the population, a population bred out of hate propaganda, gives perfect insight into the world of group think. When asked why they did it and if they felt bad, a good majority of those who participated in the genocide showed no remorse. The hate was so infused into their way of life that it had become their culture. They truly saw Tutsi as dogs. To commit such terrible atrocities means you have to see the being you are tormenting as below you. And to those Hutu, the feelings of hate were very real. It goes to show how far our personalities, minds, and characteristics can be changed with the right situation. Going back to the Stanford Prison Experiment, no one went against authority. In one interview with Hutu extremists, they stated, “I was handed a machete and was told to kill Tutsi. I walked over to my neighbours house, a man I had dinner with all the time, and cut him down. I knew him most of my life.”",2023-02-12 13:50:38+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/19372,,,443,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Often the subject was racehorses, painted in slender lines denoting their speed and grace. But for farm animals, corpulence was key. In the paintings, the cow, sheep, and pigs are massive, yet oddly supported by only four spindly legs. Sometimes, their owner is painted in as well, proudly looking over their creation. Other times the animal stands alone, seemingly ready to eat a nearby village. The simple style is often referred to as rustic or “naive” art, even though the subjects were animals belonging to a wealthy elite. The resulting images were part advertisement and part spectacle. https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/britain-cows-pig-sheep-paintings-livestock",2023-02-12 13:50:10+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/19368,,,421,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.39924.user.Davidscave.post.19345,1620420179,Davidscave,19345,,"Gustav Bauernfeind was a German painter, illustrator and architect . After completing his architectural studies at the Polytechnic Institute in Stuttgart, he worked in the architectural firm of Professor Wilhelm Bäumer and later in that of Adolph Gnauth, where he also learned painting. In his earlier paintings, Bauernfeind focused on local views of Germany, as well as motifs from Italy. During his journey to the Levant from 1880 to 1882, he became interested in the Orient and repeated his travels again and again. In 1896 he moved with his wife and son to Ottoman Palestine and subsequently settled in Jerusalem in 1898. He also lived and worked in Lebanon and Syria. His work is characterized primarily by architectural views of Jerusalem and the Holy Land. The oil paintings of Bauernfeind are mostly meticulously crafted, intricately composed and almost photographically accurate cityscapes and images of known edifices. In addition, he produced landscape scenes and watercolours.",2023-02-12 11:11:21+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/19345,,,394,0,5,1,PeerChannel,1803001645.0,p005art,2023-02-11 09:42:02,2023-02-11,https://t.me/p005art/1052,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, the Norwegian government opened the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, which is the world’s largest secure seed storage, in 2008. This 10,764-square-foot vault is buried almost entirely into the island’s permafrost — only the concrete entrance is visible to the outside world, and only scientists and staff are allowed inside. The structure has the capacity to store 4.5 million different seed types and maintains them at constant temperatures of 37.4 to 39.2 degrees Fahrenheit. The collection is stashed here for safekeeping in case of crop failures or natural disasters — because of its naturally stable Arctic climate, and also since it’s one of the least likely places on Earth to experience either a flood or a heat wave, both of which could damage the seeds. https://time.com/doomsday-vault/",2023-02-12 06:35:27+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/19333,,,5094,0,88,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Akkadian cylinder seal. 2334-2150 BCE The Myth of Etana is the story of the Sumerian antediluvian King of Kish who ascends to heaven on an eagle to request the Plant of Birth from the gods so that he might have a son. Etana is named as the first king of Kish in the Sumerian King List (composed c. 2100 BCE) which claims he reigned early in the 3rd millenium BCE. According to the Sumerian King List, Etana was known as ""he who stabilized the lands"" after the gods had created order out of chaos and established the concepts of kingship and government among humanity. Etana was, therefore, a well-known and highly respected figure and would have been chosen as the central character for precisely this reason.",2023-02-11 15:23:48+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/19297,,,623,0,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Henceforth, the kings of the line were designated as being the twigs of the Tree - and the ancient word for twig was 'klone' (clone). In later times, this Plant or Tree was redefined as a Vine - and so the Graal, the Vine and the Messianic Bloodline became entwined in the Holy Grail literature of subsequent ages. By virtue of their contrived breeding, this kingly succession was modelled specifically for leadership and, in all aspects of knowledge, culture, awareness, wisdom and intuition, they were highly advanced against their mundane contemporaries. In order to keep their blood as pure as possible, they always married within a close kinship, for it was fully recognized that the prominent gene of the succession was carried within the blood of the mother. Today we call this the Mitochondrial DNA. And so was born a tradition inherited by their kingly descendants in Egypt, and by the later Celtic rulers of Europe. True kingship, it was maintained, was transferred through the female and kingly marriages were, therefore, strategically cemented with maternal half-sisters or matrilinear first cousins. Having reached the point where the Plant of Birth is first mentioned in the records, we are at about 3500 BC, and it is at this stage that we begin to learn how the kingly succession was orally fed with bodily supplements from the early days. This original practice continued for more than 1000 years until the nourishment program became wholly scientific and alchemical. https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/biblianazar/esp_biblianazar_21.htm",2023-02-11 15:23:30+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/19296,,,504,8,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It separates out the bad cells from the helpful and lets scientists incubate them to see whether they make the sort of antibodies that will neutralize the coronavirus. If the process works, researchers will be able to sequence the immune cell, send the code to a synthetic DNA company to print the physical DNA, and then inject the new DNA into the right cells, programming the cells to make as many antibodies as a patient needs. Understandably, viruses have gotten a bad reputation in the past year. But from a biomechanical perspective, they’re just little containers that inject code, like the thumb drive you stick into your computer to transfer files between devices.

The plan emphasized the importance of separating Solzhenitsyn from his supporters as well as using their testimony from interrogations against Solzhenitsyn. KGB chief Yuri Andropov approved this plan on September 19, 1974... In 1975 the KGB prepared a more detailed and specific plan to take Solzhenitsyn’s activities under control... The plan called for KGB agents in the West to publish provocative materials about Solzhenitsyn that would give the impression that he was an undercover agent for the KGB. The plan was prepared by the First, the Second, and the Fifth Chief Directorates of the KGB... In 1978 “Neue Politik,” a western German magazine, published an article “Confessions of an agent “Vetrov,” also known as Solzhenitsyn” stating that Solzhenitsyn had been an active KGB undercover agent.""",2023-02-08 19:23:16+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/19132,,,443,0,13,1,PeerChannel,1497242922.0,vaultofsecrets,2023-02-08 17:58:05,2023-02-08,https://t.me/vaultofsecrets/11462,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,application/pdf,5.990121949211136e+18,,The Solzhenitsyn Case.

A child prodigy by age 11, he had exhausted the mathematical knowledge of two college students who were lodgers at his home. He was later lent a book written by S. L. Loney on advanced trigonometry. He mastered this by the age of 13 while discovering sophisticated theorems on his own. Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation. He became one of the youngest Fellows of the Royal Society and only the second Indian member, and the first Indian to be elected a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Srinivasa Ramanujan was one of India's greatest mathematical geniuses. He made substantial contributions to the analytical theory of numbers and worked on elliptic functions, continued fractions, and infinite series.

Affecting California, it is one of the largest earthquakes within the modern territory of the US, at a magnitude of 7.9. But the area was sparsely populated at the time and only two people are known to have died; a woman, when her adobe house collapsed, and a man in Los Angeles, who died of a heart attack. The quake left a surface rupture of 225 miles, with up to 30 feet of vertical displacement. This and other changes to the landscape were more extensive and impressive than those associated with the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, leading most seismolgists to consider the Tejon quake to be the larger of the two.

Learning and education are fundamental and important in today's society and becoming increasingly more accessible and convenient online. The availability of important information which is also entertaining helps everyone grow mentally and emotionally as people, both individually and as a whole. - In 1996, Marc Dutroux was arrested on suspicion of having kidnapped, tortured and sexually abused six girls aged between 8 and 19, four of whom died. His widely publicized trial took place in 2004. Dutroux was convicted of all charges, along with the murder of a suspected former accomplice, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Dutroux's accomplices included Michelle Martin, Michel Lelièvre, Jean-Michel Nihoul, and Bernard Weinstein. Martin was convicted and sentenced as an accomplice to 30 years in prison, while Lelièvre was sentenced to 25 years. Nihoul, a Brussels conman, pub-owner and familiar face at sex parties, was initially tried as an accomplice to the kidnappings, but was acquitted of these charges due to insufficient evidence. He was instead convicted of involvement in a gang that participated in human and drug trafficking and was sentenced to five years in prison. Weinstein was never tried, as he was murdered by Dutroux. Some testimonies implicated that Etienne Davignon, Maurice Lippens, Willy Claes, Paul Vanden Boeynants, Benoît de Bonvoisin and Prince Alexandre of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha were named as having been present at orgies involving underage boys and girls. A number of shortcomings in the Dutroux investigation caused widespread discontent in Belgium with the country's criminal justice system, and the ensuing scandal was one of the reasons for the reorganization of Belgium's law enforcement agencies and widespread allegations of corruption and infiltration of the Belgian justice system by a criminal enterprise. In the White March, 300,000 Belgian citizens protested the mishandling of the case. Michelle Martin was freed on parole in 2012 after 16 years in prison. Michel Nihoul died in 2019. Sadly, this evil is still going strong this very day, even more so. You will be baffled about what is going on in our world if you just take your time to truly research things. Perhaps one of the most shocking elements of pedophilia and human trafficking is the fact that there are so many people who live in denial and shout ""fake news"". It is our duty to unite and raise awareness. Thanks to Olenka Frenkiel for this investigation. PLEASE SHARE, LIKE & COMMENT. CONTENT LICENSED FROM OLENKA FRENKIEL TO REALWOMEN/REALSTORIES.

A thick board up to a meter long with a hole hollowed out in the middle was put around the neck and closed. Notes were often fastened to it, listing the offenses committed. The punished would spend up to several years without taking the device off. And during the day, for greater shame, he was in public places, where everyone could openly express his opinion to him. The jailers did not feed or drink him: only family, friends, or kind-hearted bystanders did. Jia could be combined with other punishments: for example, caning (60 for theft), perpetual exile and hard labor (in such cases the jia was removed after a few years).",2023-02-07 20:01:38+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/19058,,,3114,1,40,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While he was clearly a brilliant military leader, it was the story he told of his youth and rise to power that exerted a powerful influence over the Sumerians he sought to conquer. Instead of representing himself as a man chosen by the gods to rule, he presented a much humbler image of himself as an orphan set adrift in life who was taken in by a kind gardener and granted the love of the goddess Inanna. According to the cuneiform inscription known as The Legend of Sargon (his autobiography), he was born the illegitimate son of a ""changeling"", which could refer to a temple priestess of the goddess Inanna (whose clergy were androgynous) and never knew his father. His mother could not reveal her pregnancy or keep the child, and so she placed him in a basket which she then let go on the Euphrates River. She had sealed the basket with tar, and the water carried him safely to where he was later found by a man named Akki who was a gardener for Ur-Zababa, the king of the Sumerian city of Kish. In creating this legend, Sargon carefully distanced himself from the kings of the past (who claimed divine right) and aligned himself with the common people of the region rather than the ruling elite.",2023-02-07 13:05:38+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/19035,,,545,1,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One year after Mongolia was admitted to the United Nations in 1961, Mongolia's 2nd ranking Communist leader authorized a stamp series, small monument, and historical seminar to commemorate the 800th anniversary of the great khan's birth. The Soviet Union reacted with fury; Russians did not have fond memories of the Mongol empire, and saw any positive reference to Chinggis Khaan as a dangerous sign of Mongolian nationalism.

Among the Ancient Greeks, it was a widespread belief that Delphi was the center of the world. According to the myths regarding the founding of the Delphic Oracle, Zeus, in his attempt to locate the center of the earth, launched two eagles from the two ends of the world, and the eagles, starting simultaneously and flying at equal speed, crossed their paths above the area of Delphi, and so was the place where Zeus placed the stone. Omphalos is also the name of the stone given to Cronus. In the ancient world of the Mediterranean, it was a powerful religious symbol.

The kindly fairy tale grandfather portrayed by the artist became a key figure of the Christmas holidays. In the mid-1930s, Haddon Sandblom became interested in pin-ups. However, at that time it was not the pin-up that we are accustomed to. He began to paint pretty girls for wall posters, respecting the rules of proportion and, of course, aesthetics! Over time, he began to create great pin-ups, for which he earned the nickname ""Master of Pin-up Art.""",2023-02-06 12:11:45+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/18912,,,414,1,5,1,PeerChannel,1224324472.0,,2023-02-06 12:11:29,2023-02-06,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was a stiff horn-like bonnet, which was made of gemmed brocade or cloth-of-gold and worn over a camauro. The ducal horn was a fine linen cap with a structured peak at the back reminiscent of the Phrygian cap, a classical symbol of liberty. The origin of the design is uncertain. Venice was heavily influenced by the Orient through trade and cultural exchange. This ceremonial headdress shares similarities with the Phrygian cap or the white crown of Upper Egypt. When Venice was still part of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, high-ranking Byzantine soldiers stationed in Venice also wore a headdress reminiscent of the horned Phrygian cap.

Held today in the Vatican Apostolic Library, it features the @ symbol in place of the capital letter alpha ""Α"" as an initial in the word Amen; however, the reason behind it being used in this context is still unknown. The evolution of the symbol as used today is not recorded. It has long been used in Catalan, Spanish and Portuguese as an abbreviation of arroba, a unit of weight equivalent to 25 pounds, and derived from the Arabic expression of ""the quarter"" (الربع pronounced ar-rubʿ). A symbol resembling an @ is found in the Spanish ""Taula de Ariza"", a registry to denote a wheat shipment from Castile to Aragon, in 1448. An Italian academic, Giorgio Stabile, claims to have traced the @ symbol to the 16th century, in a mercantile document sent by Florentine Francesco Lapi from Seville to Rome on May 4, 1536. The document is about commerce with Pizarro, in particular the price of an @ of wine in Peru. Currently, the word arroba means both the at-symbol and a unit of weight. In Venetian, the symbol was interpreted to mean amphora (anfora), a unit of weight and volume based upon the capacity of the standard amphora jar since the 6th century.",2023-02-04 01:56:52+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/18750,,,603,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It would set out a priori a 'pure part' of legal science, consisting of a framework of fundamental concepts.

The science, would also be 'pure' in a second sense, in being solely descriptive—excluding from the science any element of evaluation.

While the name is new, the idea has long been a popular theme of science fiction, featured in such films as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner, the Terminator series, and more recently, The Matrix, Limitless, Her and Transcendence. However, as its adherents hint at in their own publications, transhumanism is an occult project, rooted in Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry, and derived from the Kabbalah, which asserts that humanity is evolving intellectually, towards a point in time when man will become God. Modeled on the medieval legend of the Golem and Frankenstein, they believe man will be able to create life itself, in the form of living machines, or artificial intelligence. #transhumanism #freemason #pdf",2023-02-02 11:58:30+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/18623,,,465,0,18,1,PeerChannel,1206929767.0,freedomball2022,2023-01-31 20:33:18,2023-01-31,https://t.me/freedomball2022/3057,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Christmas Eve in Fayetteville, West Virginia. George Sodder and Jennie Sodder along with 9 of their 10 children are having a subdued holiday celebration. Subdued because one of their children, Joe, was unable to make it home in time for Christmas. The Sodder family had no way of knowing that within a matter of hours the subdued atmosphere would be supplanted by one of terror and sadness. At some point after midnight a raging fire began to consume the Sodder's 2-story frame home. Parents George and Jennie Sodder along with 4 of their children are soon accounted for outside the home. However, 5 children are nowhere to be seen. In less than 20 minutes the Sodder's house is reduce to a smoldering pile of embers. The fire department arrives hours later and cools the debris so that it can be searched. Curiously, no trace of the Sodder's 5 children can be found. Authorities are unable to determine, with absolute certainty, the cause and origin of the fire. They conclude, however, that the Sodder children perished in the flames. 77 years later some still question the finality of this conclusion. Some believe the children were kidnapped from their home and sold on the ""baby black market""; others think a former employer of George Sodder sought his revenge by kidnapping the children and torching the home; others think the children may have been taken by another family member and spirited away to another state...or country. Using original documents and contemporary news accounts we will examine both sides of this enduring tale so that you may draw your own conclusions with this CASE STUDY: The Sodder Family Support MysteriousWV: PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/MysteriousWV DONATE: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/mysteriouswv LOOK FOR US ON FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/mysteriouswv FOLLOW US ON TWITTER: @MysteriousWv https://twitter.com/MysteriousWv FOLLOW US ON INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/mysteriouswestvirginia/ WEST VIRGINIA STATE ARCHIVES: http://www.wvculture.org/history/archivesindex.aspx OTHER GREAT YOUTUBE SITES BROOKE MAKENNA: https://www.youtube.com/user/lookitsbrookee/videos CRIMINALLY LISTED: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs3iFCPtX0gzkKxCrobO4ig DARK CURIOSITIES: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnsPZRQlFiMGOB0ferEvzdA MUSIC: https://www.purple-planet.com ""Not as it Seems"" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...

When he in 1867 — at the age of 22 — completed his doctoral thesis at the University of Berlin, he named it In re mathematica ars propendi pluris facienda est quam solvendi which in English reads “In mathematics, the art of asking questions is more valuable than solving problems”. He played a pivotal role in the creation of set theory, which has become a fundamental theory in mathematics. Cantor established the importance of one-to-one correspondence between the members of two sets, defined infinite and well-ordered sets, and proved that the real numbers are more numerous than the natural numbers. In fact, Cantor's method of proof of this theorem implies the existence of an infinity of infinities Some infinites are bigger than others 🤔 Romantic and Inspiring ❤🌻 https://www.cantorsparadise.com/the-nature-of-infinity-and-beyond-a05c146df02c",2023-01-31 15:50:00+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/18516,,,573,6,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His parents were Jews; and he himself professed the Jewish religion during the first half of his life. The difficulties surrounding this high position, which must have excited much jealousy, probably urged Ya'ḳub to embrace Islam, which he did in 967. His power continued to increase till the death of Kafur, when he was arrested by the vizier, Ibn al-Furat, whose jealousy he had excited. The intervention of his friends, and still more effectively his bribes, soon set him at liberty. He then secretly betook himself to Maghreb, where he entered into the service of Al-Mu'izz al-'Ubaidi. Ya'ḳub soon won the confidence of his new master; and when the latter conquered Egypt and established the Fatimite dynasty, he appointed Ya'ḳub director of the civil administration (978). Imam al-Aziz appointed him as Vizir al-Ajall (chief minister) and became the first Fatimid vizir.

The intrigue revolves around a classified 1983 CIA report on a technique called the Gateway Experience, which is a training system designed to focus brainwave output to alter consciousness and ultimately escape the restrictions of time and space. The CIA was interested in all sorts of psychic research at the time, including the theory and applications of remote viewing, which is when someone views real events with only the power of their mind. The documents have since been declassified and are available to view. This is a comprehensive excavation of The Gateway Process report. The first section provides a timeline of the key historical developments that led to the CIA’s investigation and subsequent experimentations. The second section is a review of The Gateway Process report. It opens with a wall of theoretical context, on the other side of which lies enough understanding to begin to grasp the principles underlying the Gateway Experience training. The last section outlines the Gateway technique itself and the steps that go into achieving spacetime transcendence.",2023-01-28 13:33:29+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/18305,,,614,0,15,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the time, Carandiro was one of the largest prisons in South America. The riot began on October 2, 1992, after a fight between two inmates escalated into a mass riot. Special Forces soldiers stormed the prison. The operation to suppress the riot resulted in a bloody massacre, which lasted almost three hours. More than 300 police officers took part in the massacre. There were 111 prisoners killed that day, almost all of them by police officers. Survivors of the massacre said that the armed police shot at even those who did not try to resist in cold blood. The investigation found that most of the prisoners were shot in the back of the head right in their cells. Not a single law enforcement officer was killed or wounded in the massacre, when among the detainees about 90 people were wounded in addition to those killed. https://portal.fgv.br/en/news/carandiru-massacre-event-had-111-victims-discussed-30-years",2023-01-28 10:40:27+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/18287,,,462,1,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is one of the more unusual items in Henry Wellcome’s vast collection. Man catchers were used in Europe in the late 1700s during times of war. The terrifying collar pulled riders off horseback. In peacetime, it is thought the device may have caught and held escaped prisoners. Henry Wellcome was interested in all aspects of life, including crime and punishment, as well as medicine.

The word vindex was removed from coins so as not to remind the public of rebellious Vindex. Construction projects bore inscriptions praising Vespasian and condemning previous emperors. A temple of peace was constructed in the forum as well. Vespasian approved histories written under his reign, ensuring biases against him were removed Vespasian also gave financial rewards to writers. The ancient historians who lived through the period, such as Tacitus, Suetonius, Josephus, and Pliny the Elder, speak suspiciously well of Vespasian, while condemning the emperors who came before him. Tacitus admits that his status was elevated by Vespasian, Josephus identifies Vespasian as a patron and savior, and Pliny dedicated his Natural Histories to Vespasian’s son, Titus.

Along with what we suspect was their extended family — the Sabas, Sabians, (the biblical) tsabians, Sakas, Scythians, Ashina, Ashkenazi, and the later Savoy, al Sabahs, and Sauds — the Sabines have a much older history than that of ancient Rome, while also extending unbroken into the present. Since the Flavian branch of the Sabines played such a pivotal role in the foisting of what is generally termed Christianity upon the world, our specific emphasis upon the Flavian imperial dynasty seems appropriate. The root syllable sab has three distinct meanings in ancient texts: in the Indo-European tongues it represents wisdom, in the Semitic tongues it stands for the mystic number seven, and in Sumerian it means shepherd. This odd mash-up of sacred meanings may be the reason why this became such a widespread signifier of royal power. At its core we assert that Western Civilization is a product of Flavian construction. To provide some background for those not familiar with the Flavians: they were a dynasty of late first century Roman emperors, who were most famous for the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE, and for providing sponsorship for the Jewish priest-turned-historian Josephus Flavius.",2023-01-26 13:47:48+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/18185,,,583,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pale existed until the entire area was subjugated under Elizabeth I (reigned 1558–1603). Its area, which varied considerably depending upon the strength of the English authorities, included parts of the modern counties of Dublin, Louth, Meath, and Kildare.

Adjusting to a population often banned from Russia altogether was a problem that Russian leadership solved by allowing Jews to remain in their current areas of residence and by permitting their settlement in areas of the Black Sea littoral annexed from Turkey, where they could serve as colonists. In three decrees, or ukases, issued in 1783, 1791, and 1794, Catherine II the Great restricted the commercial rights of Jews to those areas newly annexed. In ensuing years, this area became a strictly defined pale, as legal restrictions increasingly proscribed Jewish settlement elsewhere in Russia. A period of reaction arrived with the ascension of Tsar Alexander III in 1881. That year, the new tsar promulgated the “Temporary Laws,” which, among many regressive measures, prohibited further Jewish settlements outside the pale; and Christians within the pale were allowed to expel Jews from their areas. Occasionally, new areas were proscribed, such as the city and province of Moscow in 1891. Nevertheless, the census of 1897 indicated that most Jews remained confined to the pale. Almost 5,000,000 lived within it; only about 200,000 lived elsewhere in European Russia.

(It must have been similar to Çemberlitaş – which is the Column of Constantine – and is – thankfully! – still standing.) At the top of the column, there was a statue of Justinian I on horseback. And Justinian I was depicted as holding a Globus Cruciger in his left hand, while the palm of his right hand facing the East as if to stop the “barbarians” threatening to come from the East.",2023-01-25 12:33:07+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/18141,,,558,0,8,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After the liberation of the Byzantine capital, the rising ""Marbled King"" will lead and will worship at the church of Hagia Sophia. According to the folklore research conducted by Nikolaos Politis, the Red Apple Tree corresponds to Monodendrio of the pre-Fall Byzantine oracles and prophecies said during the dangerous sieges faced by Constantinople. However, how and when Monodendrio was replaced by the Red Apple Tree, but also what reasons the second one was based on, remains unknown. Probably, the Turkish legend of the Red Apple (Kızıl Elma), which symbolizes the ultimate goal of conquest, is relevant. Constantinople was first labelled as the Red Apple, followed by Rome, Vienna and Moscow. The legend and the term are also used in modern times. Left and right-wing nationalists who fear a break-up of Turkey if it joins the European Union call themselves the ""Red Apple Coalition"". The legend was invoked by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan during the Turkish military operation against Kurds in Syria’s Afrin Region in the early 2018.",2023-01-25 12:33:07+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/18140,,,584,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Perhaps the most well-known reference to spirit doubles or ‘alter egos’ is the doppelgänger, a word still used today to refer to a person that is physically or behaviourally similar to another person. One of the earliest references may be in the Zurvanite branch of Zoroastrianism. This sect distilled the general abstract duality of Zoroastrianism into a concept of manifest twins “born” of a monist “Time.” In this cosmological model, the twins Ahura Mazda (Ormuzd) and Angra Mainyu (Ahriman) were co-eternal representatives of good and evil. https://antiquitynow.org/2014/10/28/double-trouble-doppelgangers-and-the-mythology-of-spirit-doubles/",2023-01-24 12:50:01+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/18063,,,712,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Broadly speaking, DSD affirms that a person’s data is an extesion of themselves in cyberspace, and we therefore need to consider how to provide a certain level of autonomy and agency to individuals or communities over their digital self. The concept has been included in an official document for the first time by ARCEP, the French Telecoms Regulator, in a section of its 2021 Report on the State of the Internet, exploring the work on ""Network Self-determination"" conducted by Professor Luca Belli. In 2017, Professor Luca Belli presented at the United Nations Internet Governance Forum the concept of Network Self-determination as the ""right to freely associate in order to define, in a democratic fashion, the design, development and management of network infrastructure as a common good, so that all individuals can freely seek, impart and receive information and innovation. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_self-determination",2023-01-24 12:49:50+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/18062,,,671,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaWebPage,1,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_self-determination,en.m.wikipedia.org,Digital self-determination,human identity and digital technology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2017, Dr. Swan and her team of researchers completed a major study, finding that over the past four decades, sperm levels among men in Western countries have dropped by more than 50 percent. They came to this conclusion after examining 185 studies involving close to 45,000 healthy men.

Cathode-ray tubes are glass tubes with the air sucked out of them. Metal plates are sealed at either end and then connected to a battery or an induction coil. When charged with electricity, the vacant areas in the tubes glow. Crookes concluded that invisible rays from the cathode caused the glow. The glow emanated from the negative plate --the cathode -- and disappeared into the positive plate -- the anode. Significantly, Cat-hode comes from the Greek kathodos, going down, from kata, meaning ‘down’ and hodos, way.

Van de Graaff, who was a professor at MIT, this generator was built in 1931 as a research tool in early atom-smashing and high energy X-ray experiments. The device that bears his name has the ability to produce extremely high voltages -- as high as 20 million volts. Van de Graaff invented the Van de Graaff Generator to supply the high energy needed for early particle accelerators. These accelerators were known as atom smashers because they accelerated sub-atomic particles to very high speeds and then “smashed“ them into the target atoms. The resulting collisions create other subatomic particles and high-energy radiation such as X-rays.

However, according to UFO writer Pete Navarro, a coded story is hidden throughout the drawings, which he interprets to mean that the Sonora Aero Club was a branch of a larger secret society known only as NYMZA who developed advanced aeronautic techniques decades earlier than is commonly believed, and which might be connected to the mystery airships reported in the late 1800s Dellschau illustrates a remarkable number of designs -- maybe as many as 100 -- for airships with names such as Aero Mio, Aero Trump, Aero Schnabel and Aero Mary. (There's even an Aero Jourdan.) All were powered by a secret formula that Dellschau called both ""supe"" and ""suppe""; it could both negate gravity and drive the ships' wheels, side paddles and compressor motors.

The club mission was to design and build the first navigable aircraft using the NB Gas for lift and propulsion. Dellschau called these flying machines Aeros.

The PixelHELPER organization operates the mobile pilgrimage site and ensures the safety of LGBTQIA pilgrims on the pilgrimage site. More and more LGBTQIA Muslims are joining our movement. In the last few days we could convince over 8 million people worldwide that a reformation of Islam was finally necessary. We have received a lot of positive emails, thank you for the support so far. We are now producing the remaining locations of the Mecca pilgrimage sites, such as the stoning of the devil, which we will reproduce with three inflatable columns and colorful balls from the ball pool. We will produce Mount Arafat third and then, combining all the elements, we will go to Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels and Oslo. We invite the Islamic LGBTQIA community to support us. A permanent location for the pilgrimage site is being sought, an old tent site with the necessary space could serve as a possibility.

The final pearl detail comes in the shape of his double pearl earring Pearls applied to Raleigh's garment may also refer to his life-long quest for the riches of the Americas: in the late fifteenth century, Columbus had discovered the rich oyster beds along the coast of Venezuela ('Pearl Coast'), which from the early sixteenth century were exploited and the pearls were being exported to Europe, as for instance the famous 'La Peregrine', which, via the Spanish royal treasury and the family of Napoleon, until recently was held by Elizabeth Taylor.

After the Civil War, he worked for reconciliation between the warring parties and was president of what is now Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia.

The concept was invented by Austrian scientist Ronald Richter, who claimed to have a design that would produce effectively unlimited power. Construction began late in 1949, and by 1951 the site was completed and carrying out tests. On 16 February 1951, Richter measured high temperatures that suggested fusion had been achieved. On 24 March, the day before an important international meeting of the leaders of the Americas, Perón publicly announced that Richter had been successful, adding that in the future energy would be sold in packages the size of a milk bottle and perhaps free of charge. A worldwide interest followed, along with significant skepticism on the part of other physicists. Little information was forthcoming: no papers were published on the topic, and over the next year a number of reporters visited the site but were denied access to the buildings. A review of these reports was equally negative, and the project was ended in 1952 Perón was overthrown in 1955, and in the aftermath, Richter was arrested for fraud",2023-01-19 10:37:36+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/17710,,,548,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just before leaving for Argentina, Tank briefly met Richter in London, where Richter told Tank of his ideas for nuclear-powered aircraft. Richter was at that time doing some work in the German chemical industry. Tank had also contacted a number of other engineers and even famed fighter pilot and Luftwaffe general Adolf Galland.

From suppliers to landlords, from personal expenses to research and development, from capital expenditure to advertising, from bonuses to outside contractors, no stone must be left unturned in seeking efficiencies. The status quo will not do: a business that breaches its banking covenants must adapt violently, or face the grim consequences of mismanagement and denial. I have sat on countless boards over the years, and seen complacent managers ignore alarms bells and neglect to adopt emergency procedures when the warning signs are obvious. Many leaders lack the resolve to force their companies to adapt to changed conditions. Others have never commanded an organisation through difficult economic phases, and have no understanding of what it takes to prosper during hostile periods. Still others are congenital optimists, incapable of battening down the hatches and doing more with less. **pay bank, don't forget",2023-01-18 13:37:00+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/17686,,,559,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The early proponents of this school of thought are René Guénon, Ananda Coomaraswamy, and Frithjof Schuon. Other notable members include Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Titus Burckhardt, Martin Lings, William Stoddart, Jean-Louis Michon, Marco Pallis, and Huston Smith. For Guénon, the world is a manifestation of metaphysical principles, which are preserved in the perennial teachings of the world religions, but were lost to the modern world.

Thus, Chiang Kai-shek weakened and we stood up; Britain weakened and India, Burma, Egypt, etc., stood up; France weakened and Ho Chi Minh rose. I do not know what the American military groups have in mind. They are probably benefited and advanced by the two wars and they think they will profit in a third world war.. she may find herself in trouble.. the Bolsheviks, if they had not the chance of the First World War, revolution would have been difficult.. We got a chance because of the Japanese War and we came up.. The real result of the Two World Wars is like this and in our view, if a third world war is started, it will be to America's disadvantage. If a third world war starts, a major portion of the world will be in a revolutionary stage.""

Whilst consolidating his kingdom, he tackled a series of reforms creating a centralized state with a juridical body which was very advanced for its time. Salerno's School became known as the European vanguard of medicine, collecting together Byzantine, Jewish and Arab medical knowledge. These and other advances that were to become a reference point for the following centuries, happened under the patronage and efforts of Frederick II. But probably Frederick II most original characteristic was his ability to go beyond the cultural and religious barriers to create a relationship of cooperation with the Muslims. This led to his strange Crusade and his bloodless conquest of Jerusalem. His attitude deepened the confrontation with the Pope in Rome, something he had already inherited from his predecessors. The lack of prejudice and the inquisitive character of the emperor is shown in his own work ""De arte Venandi cum avibus"" as well as in his promotion of translations of the Classics and Arabic texts. This cultural acquisition in the Middle Ages from the area of Islam provoked a revision in the beliefs base of Christian Europe and a qualitative leap in the field of arts, science and literature.",2023-01-16 22:03:00+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/17565,,,398,0,4,1,PeerChannel,1224324472.0,,2023-01-16 05:29:28,2023-01-16,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recent discovery of quantum vibrations in ""microtubules"" inside brain neurons corroborates this theory, according to review authors. They suggest that EEG rhythms (brain waves) also derive from deeper level microtubule vibrations, and that from a practical standpoint, treating brain microtubule vibrations could benefit a host of mental, neurological, and cognitive conditions. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140116085105.htm https://www.newscientist.com/article/2316408-quantum-experiments-add-weight-to-a-fringe-theory-of-consciousness/",2023-01-16 12:37:07+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/17540,,,577,0,13,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the Casimir force seems completely counterintuitive, it is actually well understood. In the old days of classical mechanics the idea of a vacuum was simple. The vacuum was what remained if you emptied a container of all its particles and lowered the temperature down to absolute zero. The arrival of quantum mechanics, however, completely changed our notion of a vacuum. All fields – in particular electromagnetic fields – have fluctuations. In other words at any given moment their actual value varies around a constant, mean value. Even a perfect vacuum at absolute zero has fluctuating fields known as “vacuum fluctuations”, the mean energy of which corresponds to half the energy of a photon. https://physicsworld.com/a/the-casimir-effect-a-force-from-nothing/",2023-01-16 12:36:45+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/17539,,,593,0,9,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shabbetai eventually found his way to the holy land, where he sought out the company of the kabbalist Nathan of Gaza.

He was the Idumean structural parallel to Yahweh. Outside the Bible, Qos is frequently invoked in names found on documents recovered from excavations in Elephantine, where a mixed population of Arabs, Jews and Idumeans lived under the protection of a Persian-Mesopotamian garrison. Unlike the chief god of the Ammonites (Milcom) and the Moabites (Chemosh), the Tanakh refrains from explicitly naming the Edomite Qōs. The omission may be explained, according to some scholars, by assuming there were close similarities between Yahweh with Qōs, that would have made rejection of the latter difficult.",2023-01-14 13:27:08+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/17426,,,623,0,9,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the Torah describes Esau, Jacob’s twin brother, as עֵשָׂו אֲבִי אֱדוֹם “Esau the ancestor of the Edomites” (Gen 36:43). And yet, the Bible says nothing, positive or negative, about Edomite religion, and never mentions their god, Qos/Qaus (קוס; the pronunciation is debated and may have changed over time). This stands in contrast to the Moabite deity Kemosh, the Ammonite deity Molech/Milkom, the (Midianite?) deity Baʿal-peor, and the Canaanite deities Baʿal (=Adad) and Ashtoret, all of whom are mentioned in the Bible.

msg_iteration.41819.user.Davidscave.post.17424,1620420179,Davidscave,17424,,"The Origins of Yahweh: The Kenite-Midianite Hypothesis In biblical studies, the origins of Yahweh have two schools of thought. The first is as the Hebrew Bible, or Old Testament, describes—with caveats. Yahweh was among the deities of the Canaanite pantheon who, as the Israelites took on a distinctive identity separate from their Canaanite brethren, eventually adopted Yahweh as their chief god. Another school of thought, however, asserts that Yahweh has no connection whatsoever to the Canaanite pantheon and that Yahweh’s origins lay south of the Levant and in the Arabian peninsula among the nomadic warrior tribes of the Kenites and Midianites. Friedrich Wilhelm Ghillany, a German Lutheran theologian and Bible scholar of the nineteenth century, first proposed the hypothesis by maintaining that Yahweh’s origins lay outside the lands of Canaan. Subsequent generations of biblical scholars with new archeological and textual evidence open to them, began to flesh out the idea. By the mid-twentieth century, the Kenite-Midianite hypothesis becomes widely accepted in German higher criticism as well as among various American and English biblical scholars.",2023-01-14 13:27:07+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/17424,,,576,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After 35 minutes of fireworks, he returned to Peleliu with a disappointing cargo. The mixture was cold but not frozen (the squadron scarfed it anyway), a failure the crew chalked up to its proximity to the hot engine. For the next attempt (a “supercharger test flight”), they bolted ammo cans to the underside of a removable maintenance panel on each wing, well away from the engine—doubling their yield to 10 gallons, enough for 100 men. This time the mixture froze. The squadron again devoured it immediately. But the ice cream was too flaky for Reinburg’s taste, so his crew modified the ammo cans with small propellers: The wind turned the propellers, which drove a screw inside the can, churning the mixture. The result, finally, was a smooth, creamy chocolate ice cream. Operation Freeze flights soon became routine, rotated between the squadron’s pilots and airplanes. They went off without a hitch, wrote Reinburg, until his boss, group operations officer Colonel Caleb Bailey, called to make clear that he didn’t buy the “test flight” ruse. “Listen, goddammit, you guys aren’t fooling me,” Bailey told a VMF-122 officer. “I’ve got spies. You tell [Reinburg] I’m coming over there tomorrow and get my ration.” Reinburg’s Marines were not the only ice cream-makers of the war. B-17 crews in Europe brought ice cream mixtures along on operational bombing raids, according to a 1943 New York Times article, and at least one unit used its P-47s to create a real delicacy, vanilla ice cream mixed with canned fruit.",2023-01-14 06:54:11+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/17416,,,543,1,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their F4U Corsairs were only 10 minutes’ flight time from Japanese-held islands, but the enemy, cut off from their supply lines, posed no aerial threat. As squadron commander J. Hunter Reinburg recounted in his autobiography Combat Aerial Escapades: A Pilot’s Logbook, he told a reporter, “This dive-bombing and strafing just isn’t as exciting as dogfighting, but the damn Japs won’t come up and fight.” Reinburg, determined to raise morale on a humid tropical island with no fresh food and no refrigeration, had a plan. His maintenance crew cut the ends off an old belly-mounted drop tank, strung wire at both ends, and mounted an access panel to the side. Into this panel, secured by the wires, went a waterproof can that ordinarily stored .50-caliber bullets. And into that, the mess sergeant poured a mixture of canned milk and cocoa powder. Reinburg planned to ascend to high altitudes, where temperatures are well below freezing, and return with a gift for his men: Five gallons of homemade chocolate ice cream.",2023-01-14 06:53:05+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/17414,,,540,0,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On Friday the 13th, some people refuse to cut their hair or nails, dine out, buy a house, start a job, conduct business, marry, or participate in any event. Other folks are so terrorized that they fear even crawling out of bed or going anywhere on this day (including Winston Churchill, who considered traveling on Friday the 13th unlucky). As you may be aware, quite a few of today’s skyscrapers and hotels don’t have 13th floors or a room 13. More than 60 million people worldwide have a phobia of Friday the 13th to varying degrees. The fear of Friday the 13th is officially called friggatriskaidekaphobia. Frigga refers to the Norse god for which Friday is named and triskaidekaphobia means fear of the number 13. An alternate term for the anxiety is paraskevidekatriaphobia. Originating from Greek, paraskevi means Friday, dekatria refers to “thirteen,” and phobia translates as “fear.” It Isn’t All Bad… Many of those who were born on Friday the 13th, or whose birthdays fall on the 13th and occasionally occur on a Friday, consider themselves immune to any negative repercussions. In some countries, the day is considered normal or even lucky! In other countries, the ill-fated date is a different one! In Italy, it is Friday the 17th. In some Hispanic countries, Tuesday the 13th is the unlucky one. In fact, the title of the 1980 American horror film Friday the 13th (now a cult classic) was changed to Martes 13 (“Tuesday the 13th”) for Spanish-speaking audiences.",2023-01-13 12:24:19+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/17374,,,1600,0,14,0,,,,,,,1,17373.0,https://t.me/Davidscave/17373,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many were later tortured, coerced into making false confessions, and executed. When the knights were burned at the stake in Paris, the order’s leader, Jacque de Molay, cried out, “God knows who is wrong and has sinned.

The main slave capitals were Saleh (in Morocco), Tunis, Algiers, and Tripoli, the European navies having been too weak for most of this period to effect more than merely token resistance. The transatlantic trade in blacks was strictly commercial, but for the Arabs memories of the Crusades and anger at being expelled from Spain in 1492 seem to have motivated a campaign of kidnapping Christians that almost resembled a jihad. From 1559, these African cities, although nominally part of the Ottoman Empire, were in fact military republics that chose their own rulers and lived by war booty captured from the Spanish and Portuguese. There are several cases of Sephardic Jews, including Sinan Reis and Samuel Pallache, who upon fleeing Iberia turned to attacking the Spanish Empire's shipping under the Ottoman flag, a profitable strategy of revenge for the Inquisition's religious persecution.",2023-01-12 10:23:10+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/17276,,,690,0,15,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

American historians have studied all aspects of the enslavement of Africans by whites, but have largely ignored the enslavement of whites by North Africans. Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters is a carefully documented and clearly written book about what Professor Davis calls ""the other slavery"", which flourished around the same time as the transatlantic slave trade and devastated hundreds of European coastal communities. In the minds of whites today, slavery does not play at all the central role that it does among blacks. And yet, it was neither a short-lived problem nor something unimportant. The history of slavery in the Mediterranean is, in fact, as sinister as the most tendentious descriptions of American slavery. https://elmanifiesto.com/sociedad/4449/hubo-mas-europeos-esclavizados-por-los-musulmanes-que-esclavos-negros-enviados-a-america.html#_ftnref1",2023-01-12 10:23:09+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/17275,,,723,1,23,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.42013.user.Davidscave.post.17227,1620420179,Davidscave,17227,,"Baconian theory of Shakespeare authorship The Baconian theory of Shakespeare authorship holds that Sir Francis Bacon, philosopher, essayist and scientist, wrote the plays which were publicly attributed to William Shakespeare. Various explanations are offered for this alleged subterfuge, most commonly that Bacon's rise to high office might have been hindered were it to become known that he wrote plays for the public stage. Thus the plays were credited to Shakespeare, who was merely a front to shield the identity of Bacon. The idea was first proposed by Delia Bacon (no relation) in lectures and conversations with intellectuals in America and Britain. William Henry Smith was the first to publish the theory in a letter to Lord Ellesmere published in the form of a sixteen-page pamphlet entitled Was Lord Bacon the Author of Shakespeare's Plays? Smith suggested that several letters to and from Francis Bacon hinted at his authorship. A year later, both Smith and Delia Bacon published books expounding the Baconian theory. In Delia Bacon's work, ""Shakespeare"" was represented as a group of writers, including Francis Bacon, Sir Walter Raleigh and Edmund Spenser, whose agenda was to propagate an anti-monarchial system of philosophy by secreting it in the text.",2023-01-11 12:04:53+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/17227,,,600,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The group supposedly included poets and scientists Christopher Marlowe, George Chapman and Thomas Harriot. There is no firm evidence that all of these men were known to each other, but speculation about their connections features prominently in some writing about the Elizabethan era. Raleigh was first named as the centre of ""The School of Atheism"" by the Jesuit priest Robert Persons in 1592, but ""The School of Night"" is a modern name; the theory that this so-called school was a clandestine intellectual coterie was launched by Arthur Acheson, on textual grounds, in Shakespeare and the Rival Poet (1903).",2023-01-11 12:04:27+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/17225,,,572,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Dancing Plague Of 1518, History’s Strangest Epidemic On July 14, 1518, a woman named Frau Troffea from the city of Strasbourg in modern-day France left her house and began to dance. She kept going and going for hours until she finally collapsed, sweating and twitching on the ground. As if in a trance, she started dancing again the following day and the next day after that, seemingly unable to stop. Others soon started following suit and she was eventually joined by some 400 other locals who danced uncontrollably alongside her for about two full months. https://allthatsinteresting.com/dancing-plague",2023-01-10 12:14:56+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/17172,,,612,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.42077.user.Davidscave.post.17151,1620420179,Davidscave,17151,,"Byung-Chul Han in -Undinge- proposes that the age of objects is over. The terrane order, the order of the Earth, consists of objects that take on a permanent form and provide a stable environment for human habitation. Today the terrane order has been replaced by the digital order. The digital order makes the world less tangible by informatising it. Nonobjects are currently entering our environment from all sides and displacing objects. I call nonobjects information. Today we are in the transition from the age of objects to the age of nonobjects. Information, not objects, now defines our environment. We no longer occupy earth and sky but Google Earth and the Cloud. The world is becoming progressively less tangible, cloudier and ghostlier. Nothing is substantial. It makes me think of the novel The Memory Police [1994], by the Japanese writer Yoko Ogawa. The novel tells of a nameless island where objects – hair ties, hats, stamps, even roses and birds – disappear irretrievably. Together with the objects, memories also disappear. People live in an eternal winter of forgetting and loss. Everything is seized by a progressive disintegration. Even body parts disappear. In the end it’s just disembodied voices, floating around in the air. In some respects, this island of lost memories resembles our present. Information dissolves reality, which is just as ghostly as those disembodied voices. Digitalisation dematerialises, disembodies and eventually strips away the substantiality of our world. It also eliminates memories. Rather than keeping track of memories, we amass data and information. We have all become infomaniacs. https://artreview.com/byung-chul-han-i-practise-philosophy-as-art/",2023-01-10 11:36:39+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/17151,,,644,0,12,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaWebPage,1,https://artreview.com/byung-chul-han-i-practise-philosophy-as-art/,artreview.com,Byung-Chul Han: “I Practise Philosophy as Art”,The philosopher on how we might respond to a world of digital alienation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the first century CE, around 90% of the population of the Roman Empire were not citizens of Rome. This meant the auxilia were critical in expanding and defending Rome's territories. The auxilia were established by Augustus when the principate was founded, in roughly 30 BCE. By the end of the second century CE, the auxilia outnumbered the legionaries: If a soldier joined the auxilia, he would not be stationed in the province of his birth. This meant that if there was a rebellion in a province, the soldier would not sympathize with the rebellers and would not defect. The Roman auxilia was an attractive career choice for many people in Rome's provinces. It provided a steady income of 750 sestertii (150 sestertii less than legionaries), for people coming from the poorer parts of the Roman Empire, this was a massive boost to their income. On top of this income, on retirement, he would receive a pension as well as full Roman citizenship after his twenty-five years of service. Regiments of auxilia were structured the same as a Roman cohort (480 men). However, they operated on their own and not part of a larger collection of cohorts like the legions. There were two main types of regiments: cavalry known as the 'alae' and the infantry referred to as the 'cohortes'.",2023-01-09 12:10:03+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/17098,,,539,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Antikythera mechanism is an ancient Greek hand-powered orrery, described as the oldest example of an analogue computer used to predict astronomical positions and eclipses decades in advance. It could also be used to track the four-year cycle of athletic games which was similar to an Olympiad, the cycle of the ancient Olympic Games. This artefact was among wreckage retrieved from a shipwreck off the coast of the Greek island Antikythera in 1901. On 17 May 1902 it was identified as containing a gear by archaeologist Valerios Stais. The instrument is believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists and has been variously dated to about 87 BC, or between 150 and 100 BC, or to 205 BC, or to within a generation before the shipwreck, which has been dated to approximately 70–60 BC. Later clockwork is known from the medieval Byzantine and Islamic worlds, but works with similar complexity did not appear again until the development of mechanical astronomical clocks in Europe in the fourteenth century.",2023-01-08 13:27:41+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/17040,,,609,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Dynasphere, as inventor Dr. J. H. Purves called it, offered a cabin within the circumference of the wheel for the driver and passenger to sit. Purves made two prototypes. The larger one featured a gasoline motor capable of 2.5-horsepower—enough to propel the thousand-pound wheel. The other ran on electricity. In 1935, Purves developed a bus version to hold more passengers.

The aircrew, having reported the U-boat's location, intentions and the presence of survivors, were then ordered to attack the sub. The B-24 killed dozens of Laconia's survivors with bombs and strafing attacks, forcing U-156 to cast into the sea the remaining survivors that she had rescued, and to crash dive to avoid being destroyed. Rescue operations were continued by other vessels. Another U-boat, U-506, was also attacked by US aircraft and forced to dive.

It is unlikely that Marcus Aurelius ever intended the writings to be published and the work has no official title, so ""Meditations"" is one of several titles commonly assigned to the collection. Marcus ruled the Roman empire from AD 161-180. He wrote the 12 books of the Meditations in as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement. It is possible that large portions of the work were written at Sirmium, where he spent much time planning military campaigns from 170 to 180. Some of it was written while he was positioned at Aquincum on campaign in Pannonia, because internal notes tell us that the first book was written when he was campaigning against the Quadi on the river Granova and the second book was written at Carnuntum. #AA @FaithAndFolk2",2023-01-06 22:02:57+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/16939,,,573,1,24,1,PeerChannel,1876516292.0,FaithAndFolk2,2023-01-06 22:01:31,2023-01-06,https://t.me/FaithAndFolk2/1096,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,video/mp4,6.021599180407996e+18,19675.0,Marcus_Aurelius_Meditations_Audiobook__d5E2AQKuCyU_133.mp4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is done by applying watercolour to the top or bottom margin of the page, so that it is hidden when the book is closed. Legend has it that a duchess, who was a friend of Charles II of England would often borrow his books and forget to return them. After time passed, she wouldn’t even agree that the books were his. So the king commissioned the court painter, Sir Peter Lely and the court bookbinder, Samuel Mearne to find a secret method to identify his books. They devised a plan to paint a hidden image on the edges. Next time the king visited the duchess, he spotted a familiar volume on the shelf. As expected, the duchess protested. And the king fanned the edges of the book to reveal a painting of the royal coat of arms and claimed it as his.

This book is a strictly historical study, not an enquiry into 'the occult' in general, which I am certainly not qualified to undertake. It includes what was known as 'the occult philosophy' in the Renaissance. This philosophy, or outlook, was compounded of Hermeticism as revived by Marsilio Ficino, to which Pico della Mirandola added a Christianised version of Jewish Cabala.

The Hebrew Bible explains it by the formula Ehye ašer ehye (""I Am that I Am""), the name of God revealed to Moses in Exodus 3:14. This would frame Y-H-W-H as a derivation from the Hebrew triconsonantal root היה (h-y-h), ""to be, become, come to pass"", with a third person masculine y- prefix, equivalent to English ""he"", thereby affording translations as ""he who causes to exist"", ""he who is"", etc.; although this would elicit the form Y-H-Y-H (יהיה‎), not Y-H-W-H. To rectify this, some scholars proposed that the Tetragrammaton represents a substitution of the medial y for w, an occasionally attested practice in Biblical Hebrew as both letters represented matres lectionis; others proposed that the Tetragrammaton derived instead from the triconsonantal root הוה (h-w-h), ""to be, constitute"", with the final form eliciting similar translations as those derived from h-y-h.",2023-01-06 13:18:19+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/16902,,,525,0,13,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Revelation 12:9 ""And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which DECEIVETH THE WHOLE WORLD: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. --------------------- Getting saved is the easiest and most important thing you can do :) You just have to come to the knowledge that you (like everyone else on earth) are a sinner in need of salvation or we would spend eternity in Hell. Salvation is not something we could ever attain on our own, that is why Jesus came to this earth and paid the ultimate price for our sins by allowing himself to be sacrificed for all mankind so through him we can be saved. Jesus led a sinless life and by doing so was able to take all of humanities sins they would ever commit on himself making one sacrifice that covered all sin. To be saved you have to say a prayer something like this (and most importantly mean it because God reads your heart). Say ""God I know I am a sinner. I know that because of my sin Jesus came to this earth and died for me making atonement for all the sins I would ever commit. I believe Jesus died on that cross and raised from the dead three days later conquering death and making a way for me to be saved by taking my sins upon himself. I pray Lord that you save me and come into my heart and life allowing me to be born again through Jesus, living in this world but no longer being of this world. Thank you Lord for saving my soul please lead me, guide me, and direct me all the remaining days of my life. In Jesus name I pray, Amen."" If you said that prayer and meant it you are saved and sealed and nothing anyone could ever say or do can take that away. I would continue to pray daily building a relationship with God, and read the bible some everyday as well. He knows you, but that's the only way to get to know him. Try your best to stop sinning (this is not possible by the way) but you have to make the effort because that is what true repentance means is that you will turn from your sin. Don't give up, this is not easy, I repent and ask God to forgive me for something or another every single day. He knows we aren't perfect, but if we truly love him we gotta try :) God bless you, here are some scriptures that you might find helpful, and welcome to the family! :D John 3:3 (KJV) 3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Romans 3:23 (KJV) 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Romans 6:23 (KJV) 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 5:8 (KJV) 8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 10:9-10 (KJV) 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth…",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What makes life different is the presence of syntropic qualities: finalities, goals, and attractors. Now as we consider causality the essence of the entropic world, it is natural to consider finality the essence of the syntropic world. It is therefore possible to say that the essence of life are final causes, syntropy.

That seemed to be part of the bedrock of physics, but now it is being challenged by researchers following up an insight by an Italian mathematician. His work developed out of rethinking the equation that is arguably the most famous one in the world, Einstein’s E = mc2. The man who looked afresh at the equation was Luigi Fantappié. Born in Viterbo, Italy on September 15, 1901, Fantappié was regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians in the world.

If the Soviets launched its ICBM fleet, the pebbles would detect their rocket motors using infrared seekers and collide with them. Because the pebble strikes the ICBM before the latter could release its warheads, each pebble could destroy several warheads with one shot.https://www.llnl.gov/archives/1980s/brilliant-pebbles",2023-01-04 23:21:59+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/16765,,,561,1,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The strange mixture of ecstatically extravagant imagination and everyday sobriety, as well as the grossly materialistic content of its proclamation of salvation, have this in common with the oldest messianic prophecies. By asserting the scientific inevitability of a future socialist system, the practical efficacy of historical materialism unfolds. If socialism is the positive result of human civilization, all real or imagined critics of socialism are reactionaries. Therefore, the struggle against the opponents of socialism is an ethical struggle. Critics of socialism must be called reactionary because they block the way to paradise https://www.contrepoints.org/2023/01/03/446992-comment-le-marxisme-abuse-de-lethique-et-de-la-science-pour-tromper-ses-adeptes",2023-01-04 11:41:13+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/16712,,,591,1,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In that experiment, he took a dozen domesticated rats and placed them into jars half-filled with water to test how long they could tread water. Unsurprisingly, the rats drowned, but the idea was to measure the amount of time they swam before they gave up and went belly up. On average they'd give up and sink after 15 minutes. But right before they gave up due to exhaustion, the researchers would pluck them out, dry them off, let them rest for a few minutes - and put them back in for a second round. In this second try - how long do you think they lasted? Remember - they had just swam until failure only a few short minutes ago... How long do you think? Another 15 minutes? 10 minutes? 5 minutes? No! 60 hours! That's not an error. That's right! 60 hours of swimming. The conclusion drawn was that since the rats BELIEVED that they would eventually be rescued, they could push their bodies way past what they previously thought impossible. I will leave you with this thought: If hope can cause exhausted rats to swim for that long, what could a belief in yourself and your abilities, do for you? So how is that relevant to us?",2023-01-04 11:40:57+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/16711,,,630,3,20,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Woman is the embodied manifestation of the aspect of divinity she creates.

In 2021 , A mummy, fully bound in ropes and with its hands covering its face, has been discovered in an underground tomb in Peru. Archaeologists from the National University of San Marcos found the mummy in good condition in Cajamarquilla, a significant site 15.5 miles inland from the coastal city and capital Lima, Peru. The mummy is estimated to be between 800 and 1200 years old. Although the mummy’s striking pose – bound by ropes and in the foetal position – appears chilling at first sight, researchers believe it is a southern Peruvian funeral custom. The tomb also contained ceramics, vegetable remains and stone tools https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2021/12/01/tomb-horror-mummy-found-hands-bound-covering-face/",2023-01-02 19:23:49+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/16580,,,378,1,2,1,PeerChannel,1224324472.0,,2023-01-02 19:22:28,2023-01-02,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pseudo-Tertullian (probably the Latin translation of Hippolytus's lost Syntagma, written c. 220) is the earliest source to mention Ophites, and the first source to discuss the connection with serpents. He claims (Haer. 2.1-4) that the Ophites taught that Christ did not exist in the flesh (Christum autem non in substantia carnis fuisse; 2.4); that they extolled the serpent and preferred it to Christ (serpentem magnificant in tantum, ut ilium etiam ipsi Christo praeferant; 2.1); and that Christ imitated (imitor) Moses' serpent's sacred power (Num 21:6-9) saying, ""And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up (John 3:14)"" (Haer. 2:1).

He was responsible for overseeing the Meiji Era (1868-1912) in which Japan transformed from an isolationist, feudal state to an industrialized world power. Interestingly enough, the catalyst for such drastic change can be attributed to an American by the name of Matthew Perry who was a commodore of the U.S. Navy. In 1853, Perry visited Japan for the first time, refusing demands to leave immediately. He fired his cannons and threatened to destroy the Japanese if they dared to attack his ships. Japan was forced to sign a treaty allowing unrestricted trade with the U.S. and soon had to sign treaties with European powers as well. Japan quickly realized that if they did not modernize and adopt western ideals, they would end up like China. During the first Opium War (1839-1842) China went to war with England because they wanted to end the practice of British merchants selling opium to Chinese merchants. England was able to easily defeat the Chinese due to superior military technology. China was forced to grant trade concessions and favorable tariffs to the British who continued to ship opium grown in colonial India to Canton. By 1890, it is estimated that 15 million Chinese people were addicted to opium. China was also forced to open up their ports and cede Hong Kong to the British. During the Meiji Era, the samurai lost their status and power. Japan knew that if they wanted to effectively fight against the western powers, they needed to implement a conscription and build a modern army that used rifles and cannons. They began to industrialize and create factories to produce modern weaponry. In 1902, Japan created an alliance with the British, which was a first between a European and Asian country. The purpose was to counter Russia's expansion into East Asia, which neither party wanted. In 1905, Japan shocked the world when they defeated Russia in the Russo-Japanese War.",2023-01-01 10:44:09+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/16457,,,619,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He reputedly played a role at the conception of a baby and was, along with Juno, the god of the kalends or first day of the month. He was also regarded as the god of the dawn of each new day. Janus was also honoured at the beginning and the end of military campaigns. He was believed to hold war at bay and it was at his discretion whether peace or conflict ruled the earth. It was customary in times of complete peace to close his original temple in the Roman forum to contain and preserve the situation by barring passage across his threshold. Janus was also the guardian deity of non-physical boundaries, particularly the threshold between one year and the next. His month was January, which takes its name from him. Originally, January marked the date when the year’s consuls took office. Janus, therefore, oversaw the beginning of the political rather than the calendar new year. This changed with the reorganisation of the calendar under Caesar. January replaced March as the official first month of the year, making Janus the god of the New Year.",2023-01-01 10:34:31+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/16455,,,666,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Janus is portrayed as a bearded duel-headed god who bore a staff in his right hand and keys in his left. Ovid’s Fasti describes him as formed from chaos at the beginning of time, indicating how ancient the Romans believed him to be. He is also described in mythic-historic terms as the first king of Latium in the mythical golden age. In either guise, he is responsible for initiating many innovations.

We will examine the original sources Velikovsky used and understand how Velikovsky came to his conclusion and compare these to more recent work to see if all the conclusions are still valid. This episode will focus on the evidence for the abundance of Mammoth remains in Alaska as well as the petrified trees. We will examine the roginal sources Velikovski used. One of the remaining mysteries is whether the carcasses and trees were transported there during a great cataclysm or whether they existed there in a more temperate climate compared to areas around it? New evidence from recent studies will help to identify this link to not only Siberia but to Alaska as well.

Eighteen-year-old Archduchess Mathilde put on a gauze dress to go to the theatre, but before leaving, she wanted to smoke a cigarette. The young royal was standing at a window in the palace talking with her young cousin Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen. Shortly thereafter her father, who had forbidden smoking, approached her, and she hid the cigarette behind her dress, immediately setting light to its very flammable material. She suddenly felt a burning heat and screamed out. Her attendants hastened toward her and realised that her dress was in flames. Her clothes had taken fire, and her back, arm, neck, and her lower extremities were severely burned before the fire could be extinguished.

This legally prescribed marking was officially intended to protect the English from supposedly inferior imported articles. However, an indirect boycott of Reich German goods was also to be achieved in order to stigmatize them and secure England's economic supremacy. The opposite was the case, however, because as quickly became apparent, the quality of German products was mostly good, often even better than those of the islanders. Made in Germany thus became the epitome of quality throughout the world and is still a seal of quality today.

During the summer of 1863, Tsar Alexander II issued Temporary Rules for State Junior Schools of the Northwestern Krai, ruling that only Russian-language education would be allowed there. Therefore, the use of the Latin alphabet for the Lithuanian language was totally banned. The book smugglers worked to circumvent this ban printed Lithuanian language, enforced by the occupying Russian Empire, from 1865 to 1904. Sure, the official language for state business is one thing, but crucially, schoolbooks had to be written using the Cyrillic alphabet, rather than Latin, which the Lithuanian language uses. It was a direct attempt to extinguish the Lithuanian language and, by extension – culture. Underground schools were set up that used the smuggled books to teach proper Lithuanian – sometimes as supplementary after-school activity organized by sympathetic teachers, in churches, sometimes at home. The book smugglers became a symbol of Lithuanians’ resistance to Russification. During the final years of the ban, an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 books were smuggled in annually. About one-third of them were seized by authorities. Lithuanian books reached every settlement in Lithuania, and many legal institutions served as undercover transfer points for the books. The ban’s lack of success was recognized by the end of the 19th century, and in 1904, under the official pretext that the minorities within the Russian Empire needed to be pacified after the Russo-Japanese War, the ban on Lithuanian-language publications was lifted.",2022-12-30 23:55:21+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/16302,,,508,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to a legend recorded in the 12th century, Deeds of the Treveri, the city was founded by an mythological-unrecorded prince of Assyria named Trebeta, placing the city's founding legend independent of and centuries before ancient Rome's. Trebeta's parents were said to have been Ninus, a legendary ""King of Assyria"" invented by the ancient Greeks (first mentioned by Ctesias), and an unknown mother who was Ninus's wife before Semiramis. Semiramis took control of the kingdom upon his father's death and Trebeta was forced into exile, wandering through Europe before settling at Trier. His body was said to have been cremated on Petrisberg. However, there is no historical evidence that the Assyrians or an Assyrian prince named Trebeta crossed into Europe from the Middle East in Assyrian records of the time.[1] The German historian Johannes Aventinus disputed that Trebeta (whom he called Trever or Treiber) was the son of Ninus, claiming that he was in fact a son of Ninus' contemporary Mannus, who was supposedly the second king of Germany. Aventinus also credited Trever with building settlements at Metz, Mainz, Basel, Strasbourg, Speyer and Worms.",2022-12-30 23:40:48+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/16297,,,511,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence of warfare in the archaeological record includes skeletal indications of violent injury, mass graves, fortification structures, and village abandonment. Among these indicators of warfare, scalping is a reliable and easily recognizable expression of intergroup conflict. Scalping is represented by a characteristic pattern of cut marks in the archaeological record, and is therefore an accurate skeletal indicator of violence. Previous research reports that there is not a significant relationship between a victim’s age and sex and whether or not they became a scalping victim. The primary objective of this study is to present a thorough assessment of different treatment between the sexes, as well as different treatment among adult age groups at the Crow Creek Site. A secondary goal of this study is to determine whether or not a significant relationship exists between sex, age and burial placement in the human bone bed at the Crow Creek Site. Finally, this study attempts to present a preliminary assessment of the role of gender in Native American scalping practices.",2022-12-30 19:58:26+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/16244,,,443,0,0,1,PeerChannel,1224324472.0,,2022-12-30 18:28:58,2022-12-30,,0,,,1,MessageMediaWebPage,1,https://scholarworks.calstate.edu/downloads/9019s304b,scholarworks.calstate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ivory handle formed of three putti playing is in the style of Francois Du Quesnoy. His sculpture was enormously influential, especially in the Netherlands.⁣ ⁣Knives have been used since prehistoric times, but the history of knives, forks and spoons for eating in Europe probably commenced in the fourteenth century, and their use became accepted by the sixteenth century. Until the late seventeenth century it seems to have been common practice for people to carry their own cutlery, often in a leather case. Ebony, ivory, fish skin, tortoiseshell, amber, bone, horn and shell were all popular for decorating cutlery. Around 1730 ceramic handles were introduced to Europe from China.

These patients were, however, refugees. K Syndrome was an invented illness. It was created by Giovanni Borromeo, the hospital’s head physician, with the assistance of its other doctors, with the intention of saving those Jews and anti-fascists who sought refuge there. Born in 1898, Borromeo was an avowed anti-fascist. Before taking his post at Fatebenefratelli, he had been offered the position of head physician in two other hospitals, but rejected both as they required that he become a member of the Fascist Party. He accepted the job at Fatebenefratelli as it was run by Catholic friars and, according to an agreement between the Catholic Church and the fascist regime, was therefore considered a private hospital, detached from state regulations. It did not require its employees to belong to a political party. At the hospital, Borromeo hired many physicians who had been discriminated against by the regime for various reasons. Among them was the Jewish doctor Vittorio Emanuele Sacerdoti, who hid some of the survivors from the events of 16 October in the hospital. In the following months, it became a centre of political resistance",2022-12-30 02:15:33+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/16226,,,616,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other examples were tongues being removed, teeth broken, beheading, hands and feet being cut off, and other forms of dismemberment. In addition to the severity of the attack, most of the people showed signs of malnutrition and many had evidence of earlier wounds, likely from other attacks. This evidence has suggested to scholars that lives of people of the Initial Coalescent culture were under more stress than was thought; they have theorized that the people were attacked by another group or several groups of the Initial Coalescent culture in the area in competition for arable land and resources.",2022-12-29 12:03:23+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/16211,,,752,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At that time, the native peoples of that area were sedentary agriculturalists. They may have been under stress from recurrent drought.

The only assumption is that the environment follows some unknown but computable probability distribution. This theory is a mathematical formalization of Occam's razor. It is a mathematically formalized combination of Occam's razor and the Principle of Multiple Explanations. All computable theories which perfectly describe previous observations are used to calculate the probability of the next observation, with more weight put on the shorter computable theories. Marcus Hutter's universal artificial intelligence builds upon this to calculate the expected value of an action.",2022-12-28 11:35:20+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/16138,,,702,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The principle can be applied in many fields of science and logic. If two computer programs do the same job, for example, the shorter one, in which less code can go wrong, is probably preferable. Or if you are a doctor and a patient turns up complaining of a blocked nose, it is more likely they have a common cold than a rare immune-system disorder.

The Hardys once took a gold coin and hung at the King’s Chamber level of a Great Pyramid scale replica. After some time the gold coin got a clear ""oil"" on it and the gold was etched away under the drops of oil. Another pyramid experimenter replicated the Hardy’s experiment. Joshua Gulick suggests that the pyramid is the alchemists ""secret fire"". He says that he has used this secret fire to dissolve metallic gold into the alchemical/m-state oil of gold and that this oil of gold dried into, first a white powder, then a red powder. These products of gold are well described in the alchemical literature as steps toward the Philosopher’s Stone",2022-12-27 14:25:16+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/16084,,,724,0,28,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Count Ganelon came athwart, and lo, He wrenched the aspen spear him fro, Brandished and shook it aloft with might, Till it brake in pieces before his sight; High towards heaven the splinters flew; Karl awoke not, he dreamed anew. In his second dream he seemed to dwell In his palace of Aix, at his own Chapelle. A bear seized grimly his right arm on, And bit the flesh to the very bone. Anon a leopard from Arden wood [the Ardennes], fiercely flew at him where he stood. When lo! from his hall, with leap and bound, Sprang to the rescue a gallant hound. First from the bear the ear he tore, Then on the leopard his fangs he bore. The Franks exclaim, ""It is a stirring fray, But who the victor none may say."" Karl awoke not - he slept away.'

Ludwig van Beethoven (Germ./ Engl./ Span. subtitles)","Enlace a Lista de Reproducción ""Lieder, canciones y obras corales de Ludwig van Beethoven"": https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0435BEADFC19C270 Beethoven compuso esta obra en el otoño de 1808 y la interpretó también como pianista y director en su estreno, el 22 de diciembre de ese año, en Viena. Además de piano, pares de vientos y metales —flautas, oboes, clarinetes, fagotes, trompas y trompetas—, más timbales y cuerdas, requiere 2 sopranos, contralto, 2 tenores, bajo y coro mixto. Aunque obra híbrida sin precedentes, emulada sólo dos veces desde entonces (por Ferruccio Busoni y Ralph Vaughan Williams), la ""Fantasía Coral"", como se la ha venido llamando, fue compuesta apresuradamente como una pieza de cierre agradable a la multitud para un concierto prenavideño de la Akademie. Una gran parte salió mal durante ese maratón de cuatro horas en el Theater an der Wien, sin embargo estaba destinada a convertirse en una de las noches más famosas de toda la historia de la música. Una solista soprano había sido contratada para cantar el aria del concierto ¡Ah! Perfido, pero se peleó con Beethoven durante el ensayo y se retiró en un ataque de rabia; su reemplazo fue una adolescente, no sólo intimidada, sino incontrolablemente temblorosa. La orquesta, que había tenido problemas previamente con su famosamente irascible compositor, quien les había difamado en el acuerdo, se negó a ensayar hasta que Beethoven no saliera de la sala. Las partes corales de la Fantasía vinieron aún húmedas de los copistas. El primitivo sistema de calefacción del antiguo teatro, agravado por una ola de frío ese año, se averió antes del concierto. Para colmar la letanía de desventuras, Beethoven olvidó decirle a la orquesta que ignorara una repetición en la sección Adagio en La mayor de la Fantasía; Por lo tanto, mientras Beethoven avanzaba en el teclado, ellos retrocedieron, rompiendo la interpretación, por lo que hubo que reanudar en mitad, sin preámbulo. Beethoven, para su favor, aceptó la culpa. Antes de esa debacle, una intrépida audiencia se había estremecido durante los estrenos mundiales de la Quinta y Sexta sinfonías, la primera representación pública del Concierto para piano nº 4 y la mitad de la reciente Misa en Do mayor (Op. 86, para el patrón de Haydn, Esterházy), así como las obras ya mencionadas. En lo que respecta a la ""Fantasía coral"", resultó ser un prototipo, en efecto, del final coral que aparecería quince años después en la Novena Sinfonía (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thEJQF8a2-M). Incluso el tema de sus variaciones principalmente amables en tonalidades de Do relativo se parece al más célebre que compondría para la Oda a la Alegría de Schiller en 1823. Su forma original, sin embargo, se remonta a 1795 (un año antes de ¡Ah! Pérfido), a una canción con versos de Gottfried August Bürger, titulada Gegenliebe WoO 118 (""amor correspondido"") (https://youtu.be/pgNDt1umSZo). A pesar de la rápida composición (para Beethoven) de su ""Fantasía coral"", los bocetos en los cuadernos de notas revelan que tuvo sus primeros pensamientos sobre la sustancia y el tratamiento en 1800. Sorprendentemente, la publicó en 1811 exactamente como estaba escrita tres años antes, a excepción de la introducción en solitario en do menor, que había improvisado en el estreno. Nunca se ha determinado definitivamente si el autor del texto era el amigo de Beethoven, Christoph Kuffner. En la obra, se canta primero por seis voces solistas - dos sopranos y contralto, luego dos tenores y barítono - y después de esto por el coro. Seguramente, sólo un cascarrabias podría dejar de estar encantado por la despreocupación general de la obra, del mismo modo que sólo una persona sorda no la reconocería como estilísticamente indudable, del período medio (heroico) de Beethoven.

Amid this tradition, we usually spot a crouched man more or less hidden answering the call of Nature outdoors. It is said that not exhibiting him brings misfortune since his feces fertilize the ground and also bring luck and happiness for the year ahead. The figure of the caganer can not be pictured without the nativity scene —a plastic representation of the birth of Jesus that started with monumental statues but was gradually introduced in homes. Initially, the intention was to illustrate the traditional elements that were part of this moment —shepherds, angels, the Three Wise Kings, poultry, a herdboy, the river, a caganer in order to bring this world of happiness and Christmas to the everyday life of the families. Nevertheless, although adding the caganer is a Catalan and Valencian tradition, we can also find those little fellows in Murcia, Naples and Portugal under the name of cacones, pastore che caca i cagoes, respectively. Traditionally, the caganer wears a barretina (typical Catalan hat) and holds a pipe in his mouth, but over the years this tiny fellow has evolved to the extent that nowadays we find models of celebrities, politicians, actors, musicians and football players, as well as caganers dedicated to towns, to distant traditions, to jobs, and to animals.",2022-12-25 11:21:40+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/15936,,,601,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to NDR, the seven-year-old had skipped school after an argument with her mother that fateful day and somehow found herself in the hands of her 35-year-old neighbor, a local butcher named Klaus Grabowski who already had a criminal record involving child molestation. The court convicted Bachmeier of premeditated manslaughter and sentenced her to six years behind bars in 1983. According to a survey by the Allensbach Institute, a majority of 28 percent of Germans deemed her six-year sentencing as an appropriate penalty for her actions. Another 27 percent considered the sentence too heavy while 25 percent viewed it as too light. In June 1985, Marianne Bachmeier was released from prison after serving only half of her sentence.",2022-12-25 11:18:49+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/15932,,,1127,0,10,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Jul tradition was so deeply rooted in the ethnic culture of the Germanic peoples that the Roman church, as with the Ostara festival, rejected an initially intended eradication and thereupon reinterpreted and adapted the Jul season. December 25 has been documented as an ecclesiastical holiday in Rome since 336. The date is close to the winter solstice, which connects the unattested birth of a Jesus Christ with the return of light after the dark winter months. It also replaced the ancient Roman holiday of the sun god Sol Invictus. Many customs in the German-speaking world from the far north to Tyrol vary from region to region.

The game was popular across the Middle East among people of all social strata and boards for playing it have been found at locations as far away as Crete and Sri Lanka, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Egypt, Lebanon. Four gameboards bearing a very close resemblance to the Royal Game of Ur were found in the tomb of Tutankhamun. The Game of Ur received its name because it was first rediscovered by the English archaeologist Sir Leonard Woolley during his excavations of the Royal Cemetery at Ur between 1922 and 1934.

They reportedly were heavily damaged by fire, or completely destroyed, in 83 BCE. That was the tumultuous year when the dictator, Sulla, took Rome by force for a second time in his life, this time against a man named Cinna (who was Julius Caesar’s father-in-law). Nevertheless, it is thought that the Sibylline Books were repaired, or replaced, and lasted until the 5th century CE. What remained of the Sibylline Books, however, is thought to have been completely destroyed by General Flavius Stilcho around 407, when he seized or destroyed pagan objects and properties in an attempt to gain new, anti-pagan, allies—it did not work, for he was assassinated a year later. Despite this, another collection of ‘prophesies’ called the Sibylline Oracles has managed to survive until the present day. These, however, are not the original Books, but are forgeries of the originals, combined with heavy doses of history, mythology and even Jewish and Christian religious teachings",2022-12-22 19:09:24+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/15728,,,653,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to Roman tradition, they came from the Sibyl of Cumae who got them from Erythrae, and they came there from Gergis.

This ""Trojan Sibyl"" is the source of the books that eventually made their way to Rome. The Cumaean Sibyl is even thought to be the sibyl featured in Virgil’s epic poem, The Aeneid. Where is Gergis?

The Sibylline Books were a collection of cryptic and poetic prophetic riddles, in which the Romans would search for answers in times of crisis. The Books were well respected and well guarded, for a very long time, in the temple of Jupiter (or Jove) in Rome. One of the known examples of when the Sibylline Books were consulted was when Italy was ravaged by the military genius, Hannibal of Carthage, during the Second Punic War. The Roman Republic surveyed the Sibylline Books and deduced that their fortunes would change if they invited a goddess from Phrygia into the Roman pantheon of gods. They took the prophesy to heart and brought the cult of Cybele, the Magna Mater (Great Mother), into Rome with great honors around 204 BCE.",2022-12-22 19:08:21+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/15726,,,657,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Qualia can be defined as a quality that is perceived or experienced by a person, and it is a key concept to consider when thinking about the human existence, and future artificial intelligence. The best way to convey this idea is to consider the Mary’s Room thought experiment, also known as the knowledge argument. Mary’s Room is a set-up, in which she has lived her entire life in black and white, never having seen any colour. However, she has gained extensive knowledge in the theory of colour; how it is processed by the brain and how it makes people feel, although she has never witnessed colour herself. Then the question is raised, will Mary, when exposed to colour, have the same experience as someone who has lived their life in colour? This conundrum is what many computer scientist will have to face and proves to be a hurdle in the development of AI. Will Robots be able to match the humanly experiences without the ability to sense or perceive? Or is there an extent to which Robots can be developed , and it is not possible for Robots to gain this perception on life?",2022-12-20 10:25:34+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/15544,,,594,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The term was first used in 1980 by a team of United States analysts, including paleoconservative William S. Lind, to describe warfare's return to a decentralized form. In terms of generational modern warfare, the fourth generation signifies the nation states' loss of their near-monopoly on combat forces, returning to modes of conflict common in pre-modern times. The simplest definition includes any war in which one of the major participants is not a state but rather a violent non-state actor. Classical examples of this type of conflict, such as the slave uprising under Spartacus, predate the modern concept of warfare.",2022-12-19 21:40:23+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/15528,,,571,0,4,1,PeerChannel,1497242922.0,vaultofsecrets,2021-08-20 18:31:26,2021-08-20,https://t.me/vaultofsecrets/2560,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,video/webm,5.837082244295952e+18,,war.webm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As to Perchta's ability to fly, Grimm believed she also led the Wild Hunt, a folklore motif that historically appears in European folklore, and involves a supernatural or ghostly group of hunters passing in wild pursuit.

Daghda was a mystical, supernatural being with magical powers, and his strength derived from his knowledge of the hidden, which in folklore was the highest kind of wisdom. He possessed three particular implements of magical power. The first was the large bronze cauldron which was so enchanted that no matter how many people sat down to eat around it, they would all be fed. The second was the mighty club the Daghda carried with him. Its enormous size meant that it had to be transported on wheels, and it took ten men to lift it. One end of the club killed the living with one blow, while the other end could revive the dead. The Daghda also had a magical living harp, the Uaithne, called the Four-Angled Music, decorated in gold and jewels, on which he could play music to inspire any mood.

It was, after all, the first-ever self-supporting bridge. DaVinci bridge was designed while he was under the patronage of Cesare Borgia How to build a da Vinci bridge To build the bridge, Leonardo used a method that had never been used before: he laid out his design and then used ropes attached to pulleys to raise each stone block (or log) into place at once.

msg_iteration.43808.user.Davidscave.post.15351,1620420179,Davidscave,15351,,"Since 2007, an amazing story has been circulating that the Apollo 20 mission was a manned lunar mission to retrieve ancient alien artifacts and a hibernating humanoid alien named Mona Lisa from the moon. This mission had been carried out by a joint Russian-American crew. The crew included astronauts William Rutledge and Russian cosmonaut Alexei Leonov. At some point, it was believed that astronaut Rutledge was the one who published the amazing story. However, NASA canceled the Apollo 20 mission in January 1970 and in reality, Astronaut Rutledge is not a real person but an alias of the artist behind this strange story. French artist Thierry Speth was the creator of this fictional Apollo story in 2007. https://www.facebook.com/groups/1251158601603588 ""Apollo 20 is a fictional story partially written in 2006.""",2022-12-17 17:36:27+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/15351,,,508,1,4,1,PeerChannel,1224324472.0,,2022-12-17 17:36:13,2022-12-17,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,video/mp4,5.256132881801029e+18,569.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pseudo-Dionysius adapted Iamblichus’ system, modified by Proclus, to Christianity, reinventing his spiritual hierarchy as nine “angelic choirs” and replacing theurgy with Christian faith and the performance of religious rites such as the eucharist (the taking of bread and wine symbolizing Christ’s body). Instead of the universe, he viewed the Church as the manifestation of divinity.

While Porphyry (philosophy) taught that mental contemplation alone could bring salvation, through ultimate unity with the divine intelligence, Iamblichus held that the transcendent was supra-rational and could not be grasped through reason alone. Embodied souls were dominated by physical necessities, but they were still essentially divine and rational. This created a contradiction which caused the personal soul to lose touch with its deeper, divine nature and become self-alienated. The study of philosophy was important because it led to a rational understanding of the cosmic order, but the embodied soul was to return to divinity by practicing theurgy (god-work), a series of rituals aimed at recovering the transcendent essence by retracing the divine 'signatures' through the layers of being",2022-12-17 01:11:08+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/15279,,,606,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the end, only 24 passengers were admitted to Canada, since the ship had violated the exclusion laws, the passengers did not have the required funds, and they had not sailed directly from India. The ship was turned around and forced to depart on July 23 for Asia. The Komagata Maru incident was widely cited at the time by Indian groups to highlight discrepancies in Canadian immigration laws. Further, the inflamed passions in the wake of the incident were widely cultivated by the Indian revolutionary organization, the Ghadar Party, to rally support for its aims. The Ghadar Movement was an early 20th century, international political movement founded by expatriate Indians to overthrow British rule in India. The early movement was created by conspirators who lived and worked on the West Coast of the United States and Canada, but the movement later spread to India and Indian diasporic communities around the world",2022-12-16 10:46:48+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/15239,,,552,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also know we're a product of evolution. Gradual changes occurred over time to make us what we are today. One of those changes is the emergence of consciousness. But when exactly did this change take place? When did humans, or perhaps our pre-human ancestors, shift from a life of instinctual existence to a life of reason, reflection and inner complexity? Furthermore, what were we like before the change? How do we imagine humans without a modern consciousness?

Here's what he wrote in his 1976 book: Consciousness is a much smaller part of our mental life than we are conscious of, because we cannot be conscious of what we are not conscious of. How simple that is to say; how difficult to appreciate! It is like asking a flashlight in a dark room to search around for something that does not have any light shining upon it. The flashlight, since there is light in what-ever direction it turns, would have to conclude that there is light everywhere. And so consciousness can seem to pervade all mentality when actually it does not. In other words, we act non-consciously all the time – and conscious consideration of our thoughts and actions is a mere interruption to this norm.

A search of the internet reveals (a) that one byproduct of fermentation is hydrogen sulfide (H2S) which causes an off-taste in most kinds of beer; and (b) copper is commonly used today to remove H2S from beer. See, for example, US Patent No. 3,544,329A, Electrolysis of Fermented Beverages, filed in August 1967, describing the removal of H2S by charged copper plates. “This invention relates to a method and means for the improvement of the flavour of fermented beverages, such as beers, ciders, and wines, by elimination of hydrogen sulphide produced during fermentation.”",2022-12-14 12:33:47+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/15108,,,627,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were traces of an acidic substance inside the jar. The most popular theory is that the purpose of the Artifact was to generate an electric current using an acidic electrolytic solution such as vinegar or fruit juice While it is clear that this Artifact could be used to generate an electric current, the voltage would be very weak, probably less than one volt with the natural acids available at the time (such as vinegar). This would not be enough for any practical applications unless several batteries were wired up in series, which presumes an advanced understanding of electric currents by ancient Mesopotamians.

Perchta is a very old mythological figure from pre-Christian times. In the modern era, Perchta ('bright', 'luminous, 'brilliant') is a Christmas character well-known for her activity during the 12 Days of Christmas. Perchta may appear either as a beautiful, white-robed female rewarding good children with silver coins in their shoes, or as an elderly and suffering spirit meting out terrible retribution. She was once considered among the Germans, a deity associated simultaneously with fertility and death. She was the goddess of winter. In Northern Germany, Perchta is a benevolent creature, '""white as snow""~ in Southern Germany, an evil old witch that scares children. On Christmas Eve, the mummers - in creepy garments and led by Perchta go around the whole district dancing wildly and making much noise.""

This shows that training from Lucid Dream can carry over to the physical world. Also, there was an experiment of a man smoking in the Lucid Dream. Surprisingly, there wasn’t any downfall effects to the man in real life who did not smoke after the person woke up. When the brain is in consciousness state, the brain actually thought the man was smoking, and sent imaginary chemical ingredient to body organs. As a result, the man does not get any withdrawal symptoms, and successfully cured the addiction. These examples show that human brains believe what they see, and transfer false information to bodies and muscles. While in the Lucid Dream, the brain is reactivated from sleeping, and conscious. Since the brain is activated, there is more capacity for the brain to send and take informations in the dream. Thus, the dream realizes reality. The brain recognizes every action in the dream as real, and this significantly affects the body (Grothaus).

He was recognized abroad as a leading psychiatrist. He was also known for his philosophical treatises. ""I know that Mr. Havelock Ellis and many other authors will not accept my definition, because they deny the possibility of complete recollection and free volition in a dream. They would say that what I call a dream is no dream, but a sort of trance, or hallucination, or ecstacy. The observations of the Marquis d'Herve [Saint-Denys], which were very much like mine, as related in his book, Les Reves et les moyens de les diriger, were discarded in the same way.""

Between c. 140 and c. 116 BCE the dynasty ruled Judea semi-autonomously in the Seleucid Empire, and from roughly 110 BCE, with the empire disintegrating, Judea gained further autonomy and expanded. Some modern scholars regard the Hasmonean realm as an independent Israel. The Hasmonean rulers took the Greek title basileus (""king"" or ""emperor""). Forces of the Roman Republic conquered the Hasmonean kingdom in 63 BCE and made it into a client state; Herod the Great displaced the last reigning Hasmonean client-ruler in 37 BCE. The steady collapse of the Seleucid Empire under attacks from the rising powers of the Roman Republic and the Parthian Empire allowed Judea to regain some autonomy; however, in 63 BCE, the kingdom was invaded by the Roman Republic, broken up and set up as a Roman client state. Coming under the administration of a governor, Judaea was allowed a king; the governor's business was to regulate trade and maximise tax revenue.",2022-12-12 13:00:50+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/14966,,,615,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They founded the Hasmonean dynasty, which ruled from 167 BCE to 37 BCE, being a fully independent kingdom from about 110 to 63 BCE. They reasserted the Jewish religion, partly by forced conversion, expanded the boundaries of Judea by conquest and reduced the influence of Hellenism and Hellenistic Judaism. The name Maccabee is often used as a synonym for the entire Hasmonean dynasty, but the Maccabees proper were Judas Maccabeus and his four brothers.

Worship solely of Yahweh became established only after the exile, and possibly, only as late as the time of the Maccabees (2nd century BC).

There are references to the worship of numerous deities throughout the Books of Kings: Solomon builds temples to many deities and Josiah is reported as cutting down the statues of Asherah in the temple Solomon built for Yahweh (2 Kings 23:14).

The school attracted young, affluent Roman citizens, and its professors made major contributions to the Codex of Justinian.

In the 1100s, several hundred Western Europeans came to Transylvania at the invitation of the Hungarian king, Geza II. Their mission: to secure the Carpathian Mountains against the attacks of the horse-archer peoples of the Eurasian Steppe. Over the next four centuries, they built castles, churches & cities, holding the south-easternmost outpost of Western Christendom. Briefly vassals of the Turks, they returned to the Hapsburg fold after the 1683 siege of Vienna and played a crucial role in the politics of Austro-Hungary & later Romania. The settlers—known as the Transylvanian Saxons—were reinforced by later inflows of colonists from northern Germany and the Low Countries.""

Patients who were sent to sleep in a dark room during the full moon would sleep better than those who slept in a room with windows, and they in turn slept better than people who had the moonlight amplified. The most interesting effect were those who had similar sleep disturbances when they held wires that were connected to a metal plate left outside in the moonlight. He concluded that there must be a force that was given off by the moon that was related to light and operated similarly to electricity, but was not either. He observed that there seemed to be a connection between a certain type of muscle tension and a sleepwalking episode.

The B-2 can perform attack missions up to 50,000 feet (15,000 m); it has an unrefueled range of more than 6,000 nautical miles (6,900 mi; 11,000 km) and can fly more than 10,000 nautical miles (12,000 mi; 19,000 km) with one midair refueling. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the B-2 is how it gets its stealth. The aircraft is specially designed to resist radar location; the entire plane has no flat surfaces, making it impossible for radar to accurately “bounce off” it to receive coordinates. It has a payload of 20 tons and can carry as many as eighty 500-pound Mk 82 JDAM GPS-guided missiles or sixteen 2,400-pound B38 nuclear bombs – all while traveling with a range of 6,900 miles",2022-12-07 22:29:25+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/14609,,,596,6,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The oblong cards are made of pressed layers of paper decorated with stenciled and hand-drawn designs, and overlaid with silver and gold. The art on the cards is clearly medieval in origin, but the completeness of the deck, the resemblance to modern card design, and the nearly pristine condition had many appraisers questioning the actual age of the pack. The Met acquired the deck from an Amsterdam antiques dealer in 1983. After investigating the cards in detail (the dress of the Burgundian royal figures painted on the face cards, and a pair of watermarks found elsewhere in the deck), it came out that they were actually created between 1475 and 1480 CE.",2022-12-07 15:17:31+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/14577,,,564,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While still an undergraduate, this future bishop of the Anglican church worked out his trenchant criticism of Locke and proposed a simple but startling alternative. Philosophers like Descartes and Locke tried to forestall problems of perceptual illusion by distinguishing between material objects and the ideas by means of which we perceive them. (perceiver-----ideas-----material objects) But the representationalist approach can provide no reliable account of the connection between ideas and the objects they are supposed to represent. The results of this failure, Berkeley believed, are bound to be skepticism and atheism. There is, however, an obvious alternative. Common sense dictates that there are only two crucial elements involved in perception: the perceiver and what is perceived. All we need to do, Berkeley argued, is eliminate the absurd, philosophically-conceived third element in the picture: that is, we must acknowledge that there are no material objects. For Berkeley, only the ideas we directly perceive are real.

Payne explains the character of the Spanish revolution and complex web of republican politics and examines in detail the development of Franco's counterrevolutionary dictatorship.

He also explains the military history of the war and its place in the history of military development, non-intervention policy of the democracies, and the role of German, Italian, and Soviet intervention, with an analysis of the place of the war in European affairs and in comparative perspective of revolutionary civil wars of the 29th century.",2022-12-06 17:36:55+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/14506,,,459,1,6,1,PeerChannel,1402613946.0,ulrichhirschmannarchives,2022-09-01 00:01:41,2022-09-01,https://t.me/ulrichhirschmannarchives/10105,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,application/pdf,4.934213855921308e+18,,"Payne, Stanley G. - The Spanish Civil War (2012)_.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.44672.user.Davidscave.post.14467,1620420179,Davidscave,14467,,"Picts Much of what we know about the Picts comes from the Romans, who praised the military prowess of these ancient Celtic people. Some 2,000 years ago, Scotland was home to a group of people known as the Picts. To the Romans who controlled much of Britain at the time, they were but mere savages, men who fought completely naked, armed with little more than a spear. Every time the Roman Empire tried to move into their territory, the Picts successfully fought back. The Roman legions were the greatest military force the world had ever seen and the only people they couldn’t conquer were this wild clan. The Picts were so named by the Romans who observed and record them, but as was the case with many ancient peoples, the Picts did not refer to themselves that way. “Pict” is believed to be a derivation of “The Painted,” or “Tattooed People,” which described the blue tattoos with which the Picts covered their bodies. The Picts are often said to have tattooed themselves, but evidence for this is limited. Julius Caesar himself was fascinated by the culture. Upon meeting them in battle, he recorded that they “dye themselves with woad, which produces a blue color, and makes their appearance in battle more terrible. They wear long hair, and shave every part of the body save the head and the upper lip.” There is little proof even that they really fought naked. Most of what archaeologists have discovered about the Picts comes from the 5th century or later, but by then, at least, the culture had taken to using linen, wool, and silk. They drew themselves dressed in tunics and coats in pictures.",2022-12-06 10:52:49+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/14467,,,548,6,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1881 he acquired the license for the Edison patents and founded the German Edison Society for Applied Electricity in 1883, which later became the General Electricity Society (AEG) in 1887. The self-confidence of the rapidly expanding company, which also built and operated the first high-performance power plants outside the USA, is impressively expressed in the advertising poster designed by Louis Schmidt in 1888. At its center is the goddess of light, enthroned above the globe on a winged wheel, symbol of the triumph of technology (and originally the railway) (dhm.de).

The tale of her life suggests that she disguised herself as a man, was educated under one of the key medical practitioners of her time and went on to practice medicine in ancient Athens. When she was tried for practicing medicine illegally, the story goes, the women of Athens defended Agnodice and ultimately earned the legal right to become physicians. The tale of Agnodice has been oft-cited in the 2,000 or so years since. Particularly in the medical world, her life has become a symbol of female equality, determination and ingenuity. The truth is, however, it remains unclear as to whether Agnodice actually existed, or if she was simply a convenient device through which to channel stories of myth and overcoming adversity.

The Mother is the Long Wave, and she has successfully made a miniature copy of herSelf (the Short Wave) and thus ensured her survival into the future. (This act of Self-Similarity was the missing link that made the internet work, how to successfully send a compressed large file into a small file that retains its wholeness). Thus Fractal is not about Fractions but rather the opposite, its about the nesting of the Mother within the Grandmother, about the Girl within the Mother, and the Baby within the Girl, an infinite process bridging the Macro to the Micro. This is shown beautifully and elegantly in the wooden Matryoshka Dolls that nest in decreasing size and placed one inside the other.

msg_iteration.44759.user.Davidscave.post.14378,1620420179,Davidscave,14378,,"Ezio Anichini was an Italian artist from Florence. Anichini is widely recognized for his colorful art nouveau-styled covers for Scena Illustrata, the popular Italian journal of arts and culture. Less known and understood is his series of 46 images based on the honorific titles of the Virgin Mary in the traditional Catholic prayer form, The Litany of Loreto. As the son of a working artist, Anichini doubtless benefitted from the reputation and commercial contacts of his father. After studies in figurative drawing and sculpture, he quickly emerged as an illustrator for several Florence-based periodicals of the early twentieth century. Exactly how Anichini became involved with the Litany project is unknown. But whether the subject matter reflected his own Roman Catholic piety or was suggested by others, its first publication was the result of the young artist’s inroads at Scena Illustrata. In 1912, the magazine issued the entire set of devotional illustrations as a twelve-page premium for its subscribers. While Ezio Anichini’s most enduring legacy would be his extravagantly drawn and colored covers—fashionably exotic women (and occasional femmes fatales)— his early Marian images led to one more project of grand scale— his 1919 illustrations for Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy. Perhaps no work of literature could better employ the young artist’s unjaundiced passion for the ideal, for opening imaginative windows into the shining architecture of heaven.",2022-12-05 02:47:04+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/14378,,,1047,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.44789.user.Davidscave.post.14347,1620420179,Davidscave,14347,,"In the Roman arena, there were four primary classes of gladiators and a host of subdivisions that rose and fell in prominence over the years. The four main classes were the Samnite, Thracian (or Thraex), Myrmillo (or Murmillo), and Retiarius. Generally speaking, match-ups usually pitted a heavy class against a lighter class, as that was believed to offer the best spectacle for the audience. A Myrmillo armed with a sword and shield would typically face a Retiarius wielding a net and trident. A gladiator chose his style based upon his strengths, and once his class was chosen, he stuck with it. Any gladiator foolish enough to try to master more than one style was pretty much guaranteed to have a very short career in the arena. Success, and therefore survival, was far more likely for the gladiator who mastered one particular skill set. The Roman legions were similarly disposed to focus on complete mastery of a small number of key skills rather than competence across many.",2022-12-04 17:43:03+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/14347,,,437,0,1,1,PeerChannel,1497242922.0,vaultofsecrets,2022-12-04 12:24:02,2022-12-04,https://t.me/vaultofsecrets/10727,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.44812.user.Davidscave.post.14324,1620420179,Davidscave,14324,,"Funny Sunday 🌻 I have long enjoyed “blooming tea,” those special balls you can buy that seem to bloom into a flower in their bath of boiling water. I love the way they unfurl slowly, allowing time for ceremony and community to build around the teapot. A blossom in slow-motion as hearts and conversations open too. What a beautiful symbol and creative presentation! History of blooming tea is still uncertain. Some argue it has appeared only recently, about 20 years ago. Many sources say Yunnan is the home of blooming tea. Yunnan has a long history in compressing tea, which might have been a good trigger for produce this unique style. Blooming tea is a masterfully bundled ball of tea leaves and flowers that “bloom” when placed in hot water. Blooming tea comes from China, mostly Yunnan or Fujian. Skillfulness of the producer makes a difference between exceptionally beautiful and messy tea full of floating particles. Even skilled workers cannot make than a few dozen of tea balls per day",2022-12-04 12:04:55+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/14324,,,554,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is born of a deep need to articulate times of profound experience and transition, and is an essential part of what makes, and keeps, us human. Over human history, as we encountered those life-changing events, we naturally highlighted them by adorning them with art, music, poems, and prose. We created meaning in the collection of activities that heighten the moment of change, as we forged the activities into ritual. In turn, rituals can act as the punctuation marks in our life, providing us with a sense of structure. On the grand scale, they support a narrative of our lives, building a bank of shared memories and shared experiences. On a smaller scale, they are a chance to take time out from the routine and chaos of our day-to-day lives and express those things not often expressed.",2022-12-04 12:04:55+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/14323,,,530,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2004, he graduated from the Lu Xun Academy of Fine Arts, where he later became a teacher. Since 2007, Aili has focused his work exclusively on his career as a painter. Jia Aili paints his pictures in two directions, one of which has a pronounced abstractionism, and the other claims to classify his work in the fantasy genre style. The heroes of the East Asian artist's paintings are often Chinese pioneers and, in general, the youth of the Celestial Empire. Often the artist depicts post-apocalyptic worlds in his paintings and actualizes the idea of ridding humanity of nuclear weapons.",2022-12-03 17:48:13+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/14230,,,491,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was used in food, in perfumery, in medicine to relieve stomach pains and to remove warts, as a powerful aphrodisiac and an equally powerful contraceptive. Suffice it to say that seedlings of the plant were valued at the price of silver. In his work, Pliny wrote that Emperor Nero ate the last stalk of the sylphion, but just a couple of years ago Professor Mahmut Miski, a researcher of medicinal plants at Istanbul University, discovered the flowering Ferula drudeana near Mount Hasan in central Turkey.

The drought and reduced crop production in the area was turned into a humanitarian disaster when Bolshevik forces known as ""The Iron Broom"" began a campaign of massive ""tax collections"" (food requisitions) to seize food supplies and redistribute them to other parts of Soviet Russia. Lenin's call for international support was motivated by a desire to counteract the influence of Herbert Hoover's American Relief Association (ARA) in providing food aid to the people of the Volga as well as in the rest of Eastern Europe, as Soviet troops were in the process of confiscating food supplies in the Volga region. Lenin regarded the ARA as ""mercenaries"" who were seeking to defeat Bolshevism by alleviating hunger in Soviet Russia, thus embarrassing the Bolshevist government as ineffective and incompetent. This attitude was echoed by left-leaning commentators and editors in the United States, with the Nation speculating that Hoover might ""use his food to overturn the Soviet government.""",2022-12-03 12:57:56+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/14164,,,471,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Who was Willy Münzenberg (1889 – 1940)? What role did he play in the LAI? Willi Münzenberg was pivotal for the LAI. Being a German communist and member of the German Reichstag, Münzenberg has been recognised as the leading entrepreneurial force in the development of communist propaganda in Europe and beyond between the wars. What has to be emphasised is that Münzenberg came from a pacifist and socialist background; however, after meeting Lenin in Zimmerwald in 1915, this was the beginning of his journey to communism. After having been an organisational force in coordinating the work among socialist and communist youth during the Great War, in 1919, Münzenberg was central in the establishment of the Youth Communist International (KIM). Later in 1921, Lenin appointed Münzenberg to establish the embryo of International Workers’ Aid, an international proletarian mass organisation that lasted until 1935 when it was quietly dissolved on the direct instructions of Comintern headquarters in Moscow.",2022-12-03 12:57:38+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/14162,,,465,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a process outlined in the 4,300-year-old Pyramid Texts, found inscribed on the interior walls of several Old Kingdom pyramids, whereby in death every pharaoh automatically becomes the god Osiris. “In this guise, the soul’s primary goal was to achieve rebirth in the womb of Osiris’s mother. She was the sky-goddess Nut, who was herself a personification of the Milky Way, her womb synonymous with the fork in the Milky Way marked by the stars of Cygnus. Having achieved entry to the afterlife, the ascended soul of the pharaoh was reunited with both the gods and the ancestors.”",2022-12-02 13:40:51+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/14138,,,523,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the new history, Bulgarians who their contemporaries declared as a great multitude were declared by the new communist historians to have been a barely a drop in the ocean. The communist government issued ""name books"" to hospitals forcing the parents to chose only pre-selected Slavic names, many old Thracian names were thus eliminated in one generation. The swastika, an ancestral symbol native to both Thrace and the Volga was banned. An entire rework to national identity, history and religion was done purely to suit the petty agendas of politicians.

When people are unable to find meaning for any of these functions or when they lose or outgrow the meanings that they once had, they become distressed.

It is based on a resourceful image of man. In the 1920s and 1930s, Frankl recognized the human potential as an inexhaustible source of strength and sought approaches that his predecessors Sigmund Freud (in psychoanalysis, around 1880) and Alfred Adler (in individual psychology, around 1911) had taken, but had not taken into account. Logotherapy is the 3rd Viennese school of psychotherapy, after the psychoanalysis of Sigmund Freud and the individual psychology of Alfred Adler. While Freud and Adler assumed that the human being consists of body and psyche (2-dimensional human image), Frankl placed the mental abilities of the human being as a third and independent dimension at the center of his therapy. Thus man primarily strives neither for pleasure (Freud) nor power (Adler), but for meaning (Frankl).

World leaders, celebrities, and ordinary people showed their concern on social media, sharing alarming images. Yet some of these images were old photos of fires from the Amazon forest, or were not from there at all. For example, during the Amazon fire crisis in August 2019, celebrities such as Hollywood actor Leonardo Di Caprio and French President Emmanuel Macron shared these images. Famous soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo also shared one of the images, or YouTube star Logan Paul. But in fact these are pictures of fires 40 years ago, in June 1989. https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2007/oct/24/1?picture=331046325",2022-12-01 12:01:34+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/14035,,,4283,4,24,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Infamous Martian Invasion Radio Broadcast Explained Orson Welles' Oct. 30, 1938 broadcast of ""War of the Worlds,"" based on the English author H.G. Wells tale of a Martian invasion, startled many listeners who thought Martians were really attacking. Orson Welles was interviewed shortly after the show supposedly caused panic and although apologetic, in reality, he was ecstatic about it. This was before his Citizen Kane days so this made him much more of a figure in media and, being a man about legacy, this squarely cemented him one. Even CBS dramatized the panic for their anthology series, Studio One, in 1957 with an episode called “The Night America Trembled”. But the biggest reason the myth exploded was a study, later a book, by Princeton Psychologist Hadley Cantril, called “The Invasion from Mars” wherein Cantril puts numbers to the amount of panic the broadcast supposedly caused.",2022-12-01 09:32:40+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/14031,,,530,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s likely a smart businessman like him was aware of the threat it posed to his family’s wealth. But the real campaign to smear hemp was the propaganda work of William Randolph Hearst and Harry Anslinger. Hearst, one of the greatest business tycoons of the 20th century, had a vested interest in criminalizing cannabis. By the 1930s, he owned millions of acres of timber forest.

During World War II, the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 was lifted briefly to allow for hemp fiber production to create ropes for the U.S. Navy but after the war hemp reverted to its de facto illegal status. At the time, a significant amount was imported from the Philippines, but the country was under Japanese occupation very early in the war. For this reason, in 1942, the US government eased the regulation of industrial hemp and the US Department of Agriculture went so far as to produce a short film entitled: Hemp for Victory.

He was born in Michigan, and was collecting autographs at age of 12. He graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in English literature. He exposed several forgers one being author Clifford Irving, who launched a grandiose hoax involving an ""autobiography"" of the reclusive Howard Hughes; artist Konrad Kujau, who penned the multivolume ""Hitler Diaries"" [Hitler-Tagebücher] (1983); and document dealer Mark Hofmann, who forged Mormon documents. ""[Werner] Maser said: I've known for many years that the KGB is behind all the forgeries of Hitler's letters, personal documents, and even his paintings that seem to be cropping up... Nikoli Khokhlov, a former KGB agent and now a professor of psychology at California State College, concurred. He was convinced that the Mr. Nice Guy image was a product of the Soviets.""

Its difficulty of manufacture, striking purple to red colour range, and resistance to fading made clothing dyed using Tyrian purple highly desirable and expensive. The Phoenicians gained great fame as sellers of purple and exported its manufacture to its colonies, notably Carthage, from where it spread in popularity and was adopted by the Romans as a symbol of imperial authority and status. The pigment was expensive and complex to produce, and items colored with it became associated with power and wealth. Not only did the people of ancient Mexico use the same methods of production as the Phoenicians, they also valued murex-dyed cloth above all others, as it appeared in codices as the attire of nobility.

The punishment was as creative as it was cruel: King Cambyses slit his throat and flayed off all his skin and he strung the chair, on which Sisamnes had used to sit to deliver his verdicts, with these thongs.

These knives, which have musical scores engraved in their blades, brought a table together in singing their prayers, and may have been used to carve the lamb or beef in their “striking balance of decorative and utilitarian function.” At least historians think such “notation knives,” which date from the early 1500s, were used at banquets. In that context, it’s intriguing to see the practicality of a utensil being combined with an appreciation of higher aspirations. These knives, beautiful objects that combine the earthly need to eat, the heavenly art of music, and a salute to the divine, represent the values of the Renaissance very well in that regard.",2022-11-27 11:00:10+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/13705,,,573,0,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These secret documents were preferred by General André to the official reports of the military command; this allowed him to set up a system whereby the advancement of republican, masonic and ""free-thinking"" officers was ensured and those who were identified as nationalist, Catholic or suspected to be sympathetic to any of the various strands of royalism would be hampered.

But that is not levitation. https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/leading-edge-vortex In 2005, scientists at California University of Technology in the U.S. found that this motion creates an aerodynamic phenomenon called ""leading edge vortices"" (LEV), which creates pressure differences that allow certain animals to fly.

In the Scriptures we find images of the “monoceros” (""one-horned mammal"") that are associated with power: “But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil” (Psalms 92:10) sings the David, blessing God for His continued support. The horn is the symbol for masculine power and virility, celebrated in ancient rites of anointing of a lingham stone or glass representing the Life Force. Anointing of the “horn” is found also in Psalm 23: “Thou has anointed my head with oil; my cup overflows.” This assertion echoes ancient pagan rites of the “sacred marriage” uniting the king with the princess or priestess who represented her land and people. It was the role of the “Bride” to anoint the Sacred King and to be united with him in the bridal chamber, where the consummation of their marriage brought blessings of life and fertility to the people, crops, and herds of the realm.",2022-11-26 10:51:50+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/13656,,,523,0,8,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This reflex includes such things as decent behavior; prohibiting the coed from taking off her dress in public; tearing up the auditorium and wreaking destruction.

In the illustration, Columbia, the female personification of America is seen shielding a Chinese immigrant. In her book Driven Out, Jean Pfaelzer quotes a New York Times article on the role of the Irish against the Chinese: It was well known that the chief objection to the Chinese in California comes from the Irish. It was from this class that the Democratic Party used to draw most of the political capital which it gained by fostering the prejudices against the Negro. Fleeing to this country, as they claimed, to escape British oppression, the Irish immigrant always made haste to join the ranks of the oppressors here. They voted, almost to a man, with the Democratic Party…now that slavery is abolished, we find them in the front ranks of the haters and persecutors of the Chinese.

It was through hard work for the Empire, merit, luck, and knowing the right elites, that one could earn the official legal status of a “free man.” The Romans had devised a class system and a government that had kept a fine line between the two political factions. The most powerful were Rome’s Republican Patrician elite and the least powerful class were known as the plebs, or plebeian commoners. One of the methods they used to keep order was to have different cults that could be celebrated among the common people depending on the class to which they belonged. For the Roman plebs and plebeian commoners, their faith was based on “The Cult of Liber (Liber Pater)”, which has its origins in Rome during the third century BC, but goes back much further in history to the Ancient Greeks. The cult allowed the plebeians who had been excluded from membership in other cults by law and did not belong to the original aristocracy families to claim equal rights and opportunities as the elite class.",2022-11-24 21:10:49+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/13525,,,571,2,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

W. Stalin correctly observed is the party’s strongest and sharpest weapon.

msg_iteration.45663.user.Davidscave.post.13462,1620420179,Davidscave,13462,,"Myth The constellation Draco is associated with several myths, most frequently with the one about the 12 labours of Heracles, represented by the neighbouring constellation Hercules. In the myth, Draco represents Ladon, the dragon that guarded the golden apples in the gardens of the Hesperides. The golden apple tree was a wedding present to Hera when she married Zeus. She planted the tree in her garden on Mount Atlas and tasked Atlas’ daughters, the Hesperides, with guarding it. She also placed the dragon Ladon around the tree so that the Hesperides would not pick any apples from it. In some versions of the myth, Ladon had a hundred heads and was the child of the monster Typhon and Echidna, who was half woman and half serpent. In others, he was the offspring of two sea deities, Ceto and Phorcys, and there is no mention of the number of heads he had. As part of his 12 labours, Heracles was asked to steal some golden apples from the tree. He defeated Ladon with his poisoned arrows and took the apples. Saddened by the dragon’s passing, Hera placed its image in the sky among the constellation. Draco is usually depicted coiled around the North Pole, with one foot of Heracles on its head. In Roman mythology, Draco was one of the Giant Titans who warred with the Olympian gods for ten years. The Titan met his end at the hands of the goddess Minerva and was thrown into the sky, where it froze around the North Pole.",2022-11-24 10:48:09+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/13462,,,519,2,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beginning in the 1960s after the Second Vatican Council, liberation theology became the political praxis of Latin American theologians such as Gustavo Gutiérrez, Leonardo Boff, and Jesuits Juan Luis Segundo and Jon Sobrino, who popularized the phrase ""preferential option for the poor."" It arose principally as a moral reaction to the poverty and social injustice in the region, which Cepal, a leftist think tank, deemed the most unequal in the world. This expression was used first by Jesuit Fr. General Pedro Arrupe in 1968 and soon after this the World Synod of Catholic Bishops in 1971 chose as its theme ""Justice in the World"". https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_American_liberation_theology",2022-11-24 10:43:37+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/13460,,,1230,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The original caption read: “Goat suckling a child in 1958, El Mojon, Teguise, Lanzarote.” Throughout history, goats have been used as wet nurses when the mother could not produce milk or hiring a human wet nurse was too expensive. In the 16th century, many mothers rejected wet nurses for fear of infecting their newborn with syphilis. Pierre Brouzet, who was a physician to King Louis the XV, remarked that “some peasants who have no other nurses but ewes, and these peasants were as strong and vigorous as others.” In the 1976 book, “American Folk Medicine: A Symposium,” author Wayland D. Hand discusses the phenomenon in more detail: “Because milk does not keep well once it is separated from the animal and because the act of suckling was believed to aid digestion in infancy, medical writers beginning in the eighteenth century began to advocate nursing children directly at the udders of goats. Goats were easier to obtain and cheaper than human wet nurses; they were safer from disease and were better in many other respects. Although cows’ milk was almost exclusively used in early American infant feeding, William Potts Dewees, who wrote the first American pediatric treatise in 1825, called attention to animal milks and pointed out that the English praised asses’ milk; nevertheless, he preferred milk of goats. He then compared the chemical constituents of milk from cows, women, goats, asses, sheep, and mares. In 1816, Conrad A. Zwierlein, after listening to women at a fashionable European resort deploring their difficulties with wet nurses, wrote a book called, ‘The Goat as the Best and Most Agreeable Wet Nurse,’ which he dedicated to vain and coquettish women, as well as to sick, tender, and weak ones. Goat feeding then became very popular for a while until it was attacked on various grounds and fell into disfavor. In 1879, it was revived in the children’s hospitals of Paris, especially for syphilitic infants.” Source: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2016/02/25/why-goats-used-to-breastfeed-human-babies/",2022-11-23 11:12:19+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/13396,,,834,0,8,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While there is some mention of the phenomenon in antiquity, especially during the Hasmonean period (c. 140–37 BCE), most Jewish pirates were Sephardim who operated in the years following the Alhambra Decree ordering the expulsion of Iberia's Jews. Upon fleeing Spain and Portugal, some of these Jews became pirates and turned to attacking the Catholic Empire's shipping as both Barbary corsairs from their refuge in the Ottoman dominions, as well as privateers bearing letters of marque from Spanish rivals such as the United Netherlands. Many Jews also were involved in backing Spanish-attacking privateers economically. They viewed this campaign to be a profitable strategy of revenge for their expulsion and the Inquisition's continued religious persecution of their Jewish and converso brethren in both the Old and New Worlds. After Jews were expelled from Spain and Portugal, many of them settled in the friendlier Muslim lands of the Mediterranean (the Ottoman Empire for example). Like their Muslim compatriots who were likewise expelled in 1492, Jews were also looking to get revenge against Iberian Christians by sharing with Muslims the newest military techniques and secrets used by Christians. And they also joined in on Muslim anti-Christian piracy of the Mediterranean, such as Sinan Reis and Samuel Pallache.

The black flag symbolises death and fear, and traditionally signaled that those who surrendered without a fight would be allowed to live. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolly_Roger",2022-11-23 10:03:22+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/13386,,,570,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.45753.user.Davidscave.post.13372,1620420179,Davidscave,13372,,"In terms of history, black mirrors were made of polished obsidian glass (volcanic rock), and were first brought back by Hernando Cortés in 1530 after his conquest of Mexico. The Aztec priests used them to conjure visions and make prophesies of the future. Obsidian mirrors were used ritually to spiritually access the Aztec underworld and communicate with the realm of the dead. They were said to be used for a ruler to see the future, and for others to see themselves look back at them. Later, John Dee, with the help of a psychic-medium (and convicted criminal) Edward Kelley, had conversations and visions of angels in the mirror’s reflective surface, creating what is known as the ""Ennochian"" language, said to be the precursor to ancient Hebrew, and the language that God used to speak to Adam. These angels (or perhaps demons) requested certain real-world things happen, in payment for the information they imparted. These acts and requests became more and more deprived towards the end of Dee's experimentation. This is very occult, with little known about what, if anything, was found to be true. Dee believed that this practice would result in the the beings/angels contacted through the mirror, having knowledge that would aid the English in the domination of the known (and at that time, unknown world). Essentially, he sought information that he could use to guide the future. Interestingly, Dee has since been suggested to be a spy for Queen Elizabeth I, and part of the original MI5, and signed his letters with the signature '007'. Dee would eventually force Kelley to stare into the mirror for long 'scrying' sessions, pushing him to the edge of madness, if not deep into the territory of it. In summary, black mirrors are said to be a tool of prophesy, but if one looks too hard into them, for too long, madness awaits, and the looker may be consumed by their visions of the possible. In this respect, it may be argued that a black mirror is nothing but the reflection of one's soul in that, it is what the soul wants without heeding any danger (or listening too closely without caution) towards something fundamentally uncertain, and will likely result in a terrible state of reality for them. They spring forth warnings of what may be, possibly even will be.",2022-11-23 01:54:40+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/13372,,,618,2,12,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""The past has only recently been replaced."" it adds, and the claim continues: ""On the left, the year 890 above the arch in Latin letters; on the right, the M in the photo was added after restoration, and the building has drastically changed the year to 1890."" However, the M is very blotchy in the photo, the shape and spacing are not correct and otherwise do not match the rest of the letters. Restoration means to restore the original faithfully. So if you look at the whole thing up close, it becomes clear that it has been worked on and the whole thing is a lie. This is also proven by older pictures of the building, because there are many other historical pictures that show the M in its original state.",2022-11-22 19:13:34+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/13349,,,529,0,9,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Harappan civilization developed along the mighty river, Indus and for that reason it is also known as the Indus Valley Civilization. Despite this dearth of excavations, the few Indus Valley archaeological sites that have been analyzed reveal a complex, urbanized society that was involved in sophisticated urban planning and large-scale building projects (such as large baths and multi-story buildings), as well as numerous crafts, including pottery-making, metallurgy, lapidary (stone and gem) arts and brick-making. Food production was an important endeavor for such a large population, and the Indus Valley people utilized an irrigation system that involved storing water in large tanks to grow several important food crops, including barley, wheat, sesame and various legumes, according to Belcher. Cotton was also an important crop for the civilization's clothing and textiles. The Indus Valley people raised domesticated animals, including cattle, water buffalo, pigs, sheep and goats.

Back then, Weinsberg was part of the Holy Roman Empire.⁣ ⁣ Before ordering the final assault, Conrad decided to spare the lives of all the women in the city. He allowed them to leave with whatever they could carry on their shoulders. ⁣ The women left behind all their possessions and came out carrying their husbands.⁣ ⁣ When Conrad saw this, all he could do was laugh and accept their clever subterfuge. Conrad remarked that a king should always keep his word.⁣ ⁣ Today, the women who saved their husband's lives and the city are known as the ""Treue Weiber von Weinsberg"" (Loyal Wives of Weinsberg). The castle ruins still exist and are known as as Weibertreu (""wifely loyalty"").⁣ ⁣ Source: http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0875ast.html",2022-11-22 11:04:10+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/13291,,,553,0,8,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Venice parasitized the decline of much larger states, a decline that Venice itself strove to organize, sometimes in a long and gradual descending curve, but sometimes in a quick bonanza of looting. Venice was repeatedly confronted with the problem posed by a triumphant enemy, at the height of his power, who would be perfectly capable of crushing the Serenissima in short order. This enemy had to be manipulated into self-destruction, not in any old way, but in the precise and specific way that served the Venetian interest. Does this sound impossible? What is astounding is how often it has succeeded. In fact, it's succeeding in a very real sense in the world today.

In 1423, the Doge Tommaso Mocenigo had urged upon his fellow oligarchs a policy of expansionism which would make them the overlords “of all the gold and of Christendom.” The essence of oligarchism is summed up in the idea of the empire, in which an elite identifying itself as a master race rules over a degraded mass of slaves or other oppressed victims. If oligarchical methods are allowed to dominate human affairs, they always create a breakdown crisis of civilization, with economic depression, war, famine, plague, and pestilence. Examples of this are the fourteenth century Black Plague crisis and the Thirty Years War (1618-48), both of which were created by Venetian intelligence. The post- industrial society and the derivatives crisis have brought about the potential for a new collapse of civilization in our own time. This crisis can only be reversed by repudiating in practice the axioms of the oligarchical mentality.",2022-11-21 14:26:59+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/13210,,,602,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Church must be the great conservative factor in home life, in the development of the family, in the development of this foundation stone of the community. The fruits of the Church’s teachings and example are picked by the State.. Where will you find better citizenship, where indeed will you find more orderliness than in a community which finds its home in the bosom of the Church? Disorder, quarrels and strife do not fit in with the teachings of the Church, and whilst our human weakness does not keep us from falling into quarrels it is nevertheless an indisputable fact that where you have a Christian people, bound to its Church, you find an orderly people where there is no room for revolt and revolution.""

Appearing first in French in 1948, it has reached the status of a classic that retains all of its relevance today in the face of the challenges that beset us. How should we respond toward such complex forces as technology or the state? How can we communicate with one another, despite the problems inherent in modern forms of media? Do we have hope for the future of our civilization? Ellul responds by describing how a Christian's unique presence in the world can make a difference. #ethics #christian #socialissues #society #theology #pdf",2022-11-20 18:13:32+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/13139,,,503,0,3,1,PeerChannel,1206929767.0,freedomball2022,2022-11-19 23:20:51,2022-11-19,https://t.me/freedomball2022/1634,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A little monster peeping out from under the bed–curtains tempts the miser with a bag of gold, while an angel kneeling at the right encourages him to acknowledge the crucifix in the window. Death, holding an arrow, enters at the left. Oppositions of good and evil occur throughout the painting. A lantern containing the fire of Hell, carried by the demon atop the bed canopy, balances the cross which emits a single ray of divine light. The figure in the middle ground, perhaps representing the miser earlier in his life, is shown as hypocritical; with one hand he puts coins into the strongbox where they are collected by a rat–faced demon, and with the other he fingers a rosary, attempting to serve God and Mammon at the same time. A demon emerging from underneath the chest holds up a paper sealed with red wax — perhaps a letter of indulgence or a document that refers to the miser's mercenary activities. This type of deathbed scene derives from an early printed book, the Ars Moriendi or ""Art of Dying,"" which enjoyed great popularity in the second half of the fifteenth century. The panel may have been the left wing of an altarpiece; the other panels — now missing — would have clarified the meaning of some aspects of the scene, such as the discarded and broken armor and weapons in the foreground.",2022-11-20 05:22:57+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/13095,,,398,0,3,1,PeerChannel,1224324472.0,,2022-11-19 21:20:05,2022-11-19,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, there are delicate embellishments of blue crystals and turquoise, as well as concentric circles designed around the handle. Exquisitely forged from copper and tin, the markings on the sword also remain in excellent condition. The decorative patterns are accompanied by text. Two columns containing eight characters are engraved on one side of the blade in an ancient writing called bird-worm seal script. After months of debate as to the historical owner of the sword, experts have attributed it to the King of Yue, who's famous for his perseverance in time of hardship.

This ancient Chinese dagger is more than 2,500 years old. Because of its still-impeccable condition, however, it's considered one of those swords that mythically defies the tests of time. In 1965, an excavation team discovered the Sword of Goujian in a tomb in Hubei, China. Encased in a nearly air-tight wooden box next to a skeleton, archaeologists believe that it’s an artifact from 771 to 403 BC. They were stunned that its blade was perfectly untarnished—despite being buried in damp conditions for over two millennia. This unusual resistance to deterioration is rare in artifacts that date back this far. It's still sharp, too. A test affirmed that the blade could easily cut a stack of twenty pieces of paper.",2022-11-19 08:29:16+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/12995,,,2709,0,38,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, the man had to fight in a hole with one of his arms tied behind his back. The woman was allowed to move freely within the arena but had to wear cloth containing weights. As for her weapon, she was usually given a sack filled with rocks. The man was provided with three clubs. However, if he touched the side of the hole during combat, he had to forfeit one of his clubs. Married couples were usually given a month or two to settle their differences prior to combat. The duel would only take place if they could not compromise and make peace with each other. If the husband lost the duel, he would have his head cut off. If the wife lost the duel, she would be buried alive.

Mention of this island is found not only in the Irish, but almost in all European nations. It has been mentioned for centuries. Most maps place it 200 miles off the west coast of Ireland in the North Atlantic. It looks like an oval with a river flowing inside it from east to west. In 1375, a Catalan atlas was created by Abraham Crescer commissioned by King Juan I. It depicted the island as two small islands. In 1436 it appeared on Andrea Bianco's maps as Sola De Brasil. In 1595 the island appears again in the European Atlas of Abraham Ortelius. All subsequent attempts to find the island were unsuccessful, it simply did not exist.

It is named after Will H. Hays , Presbyterian lawyer and politician and president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America ( MPPDA) from 1922 to 1945. Under Hays's leadership, the MPPDA (later known as the MPAA), adopted a code ofself- censorship in 1930, which was applied more strictly from 1934 onwards. This code spelled out what content was acceptable or unacceptable for films produced in the United States . Between 1934 and 1954, the Hays code was closely identified with Joseph Breen , the administrator appointed by Hays to implement the code as director of the Production Code Administration (PCA). The film industry followed the code to the letter until 1956, when—due to the impact of television, the influence of foreign films, and Supreme Court intervention—the code underwent slight changes. As a result of the counterculture of the 1960s, a number of filmmakers began deliberately violating the code. In 1964, Sidney Lumet included scenes of nude women in The Pawnbroker. It was one of the first American films to feature nudity scenes and although the MPAA assured that it was an exception, shortly afterwards other directors began to face the Hays code, which was replaced in 1968 by the MPAA rating system that still exists today in effect.",2022-11-18 10:58:48+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/12922,,,512,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He became one of Hollywood’s first sex symbols after starring in the film, The Cheat (1915) in which he plays a cruel villain (there’s a scene in which he literally brands a woman). Despite his portrayal, Hayakawa became extremely popular with American women for his “broodingly handsome” good looks. At one point, he was the highest paid actor in Hollywood (making over $3,500 a week), and his fame was on par with that of Charlie Chaplin. Although, Hayakawa was highly sought after during the 1910s and early 1920s, he became disillusioned by constantly being typecast for the same roles. He decided to start his own production company to fight Asian stereotypes and ended up producing 23 films in a span of three years. However, he had to scrap his company after getting into an argument with a distributor who called him a racial slur. By the 1930s, Hollywood had set strict moral guidelines called the Hays Code which prohibited interracial love to be portrayed on screen. As a result, Hayakawa continued to be cast as either a villain or a “forbidden lover” since most of his costars were white women.",2022-11-18 10:58:08+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/12920,,,512,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He commanded her to call up the spirit of the prophet Samuel who, during his lifetime, had been Saul's mentor and the grey eminence behind the throne. Samuel, the last Judge of the Israelites, had himself anointed Saul as their first king. In a cantankerous mood at being recalled from the Shades, Samuel foretold the worst, that neither Saul nor his sons would survive the morrow. In the ensuing battle his three sons were slain and Saul, wounded, threw himself on his own sword rather than meet death at the hands of his enemies.

They have invented a phrase, a phrase that is a black and white contradiction in two words — ‘free-love’ — as if a lover ever had been, or ever could be, free. It is the nature of love to bind itself, and the institution of marriage merely paid the average man the compliment of taking him at his word. Modern sages offer to the lover, with an ill-flavoured grin, the largest liberties and the fullest irresponsibility; but they do not respect him as the old Church respected him; they do not write his oath upon the heavens, as the record of his highest moment.

msg_iteration.46319.user.Davidscave.post.12797,1620420179,Davidscave,12797,,"Hans Kohn (1891-1971), the Prague-born founding father of Nationalism Studies, insisted as of the interwar years, that nationalism is not innate. Kohn, who moved to the United States in the 1930s, was a politically engaged scholar, whose theory of nationalism made a significant impact in shaping western debates during the Cold War.Nationalism, he argued, is first and foremost “a state of mind,” and a modern one at that. Nationalism, as a mass phenomenon, he insisted, was simply inconceivable in the premodern world and its centralized states. It was only in the modern world—when nationalism became possible and then inevitable—that the past was inaccurately cast along clear national lines. The most memorable of Kohn’s many books, The Idea of Nationalism (1944), was a pathbreaking study precisely of that transition from the pre-national past to “the Age of Nationalism.” By theorizing nationalism, Kohn clearly hoped to tame it. By claiming the modernity of nations, he countered the insistence on a well-defined national collective going back to time immemorial. Further, if the national sentiment was created by a certain historical context, another historical context may replace it with other more modern identities and political allegiances. In other words, historicizing nationalism restrains its license. In the second half of the 20th century Kohn’s approach was adopted, developed and popularized by a younger cohort of scholars—such as Eric Hobsbawm, Ernest Gellner, and Benedict Anderson—who spoke of nations and nationalism as “imagined communities” with “invented traditions.”",2022-11-17 02:01:09+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/12797,,,612,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Once upon a time, there lived in Rome of the 2nd century a young girl called Crepereia Tryphaena, possibly of freed Greek slaves’ family (liberti). She was to be married to Filetus, an army officer, whose return from a military campaign she was awaiting, but unfortunately the girl suddenly died just before her wedding, at the age of about 18-20. She was buried in her wedding dress in a marble sarcophagus alongside her childhood toys. During excavations in 1889 near the Tiber river, the sarcophagus was found. Alongside the skeleton in the sarcophagus was an ivory doll, probably with a symbolic function and a golden ring bearing the name Filetus. (At the time, the custom was for brides-to-be to sacrifice the dolls from their childhood to Aphrodite (Venus), the goddess of Love and Beauty, on their wedding day to symbolize the entering into the life of a wife and that their virginity would end.) The doll is of extraordinary artistic and handcrafted quality. Her hairstyle is according to common hair-does in Rome. These sophisticated proto-Barbies are anatomically female, with developed hips and busts artfully provided with articulated joints at the shoulders, elbows, thighs and knees, and were obviously designed to be dressed.",2022-11-15 19:11:13+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/12719,,,598,0,0,1,,,,2022-11-15 18:27:58,2022-11-15,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After extensive testing of a skin sample from the mummy, it turned out to be gelatin and this ancient giant was a fake. The Salt Lake Tribune also wrote an article about it in 1908, however, the headline and true content of the article is readily omitted/hidden with these images. https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045396/1908-06-07/ed-1/seq-17/",2022-11-15 17:49:38+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/12708,,,3686,0,29,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We barely had enough time to complete the program, and contemporary art existed somewhere in parallel, we didn't intersect with it. And the history of art in the institute was beautifully taught until the twentieth century. And then there is a silence. There's a gap, like an abyss that you have to try not to notice, to draw the old into the new. It is clear that there is no limit to perfection, and you have to keep sketching, sketching, writing some kind of studies, just not to lose the knack, the skill. It's not clear how to apply that to what's really around you. It wasn't even about replacing a Venetian jug in a still life with a cell phone, that would have been a purely material substitution. And there was some dissonance in the way you drive to the institute, the way you drive back and live after the institute, what movies you watch and what music you listen to - and what you do at the institute.

msg_iteration.46533.user.Davidscave.post.12577,1620420179,Davidscave,12577,,"Is gesture a universal language? When lost for words, we point, wave, motion and otherwise use our hands to attempt to indicate meaning. However, much of this form of communication is intuitive and is not generally seen to be, by itself, an effective substitution for speech. John Bulwer (1606 – 1656), an English doctor and philosopher, attempted to record the vocabulary contained in hand gestures and bodily motions and, in 1644, published Chirologia, or the Naturall Language of the Hand alongside a companion text Chironomia, or the Art of Manual Rhetoric, an illustrated collection of hand and finger gestures that were intended for an orator to memorise and perform whilst speaking. For Bulwer, gesture was the only from of speech that was inherently natural to mankind, and he saw it as a language with expressions as definable as written words. He describes some recognisable hand gestures, such as stretching out hands as an expression of entreaty or wringing them to convey grief, alongside more unusual movements, including pretending to wash your hands as a way to protest innocence, and to clasp the right fist in the left palm as a way to insult your opponent during an argument. Although Bulwer’s theory has its roots in classical civilisation, from the works of Aristotle, he was inspired by hundreds of different works, including biblical verses, medical texts, histories, poems and orations, in order to demonstrate his conclusions. The language of gesture proved a popular subject in the age of eloquence, and inspired many similar works. Bulwer’s work was primarily meant for the pulpit, but also had applications for the stage. Although we do not know if these hand gestures were ever used by public speakers as they were intended, there is some evidence of the book’s impact on popular culture. Laurence Sterne’s novel Tristram Shandy (completed in 1767) features characters who clasp their hands together in the heat of argument, one who dramatically holds his left index finger between his right thumb and forefinger to signal a dispute, and another who folds his hands as a gesture of idleness. This was not the end for the Chirologia, however. Some years after publishing the book, Bulwer became one of the first people in England to propose educating deaf people. Although the link to deaf studies seems evident, the Chirologia only makes passing reference to deafness, but this nevertheless may have inspired Bulwer’s further research in the area, and how fingerspelling and gesture can be used as a form of communication in themselves. The hand shapes described in the Chirologia are still used in British Sign Language today.",2022-11-13 12:27:55+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/12577,,,967,0,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although most were discarded as impractical, they nonetheless would have served as the basis for action had a conflict occurred. At no point was it considered likely that the Soviet Union or United States would resort to war, only that one could potentially occur as a result of a miscalculation. Planning was conducted by agencies of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in collaboration with planners from the United Kingdom and Canada. American intelligence assessments of the Soviet Union's capabilities were that it could mobilize as many as 245 divisions, of which 120 could be deployed in Western Europe, 85 in the Balkans and Middle East, and 40 in the Far East. All war plans assumed that the conflict would open with a massive Soviet offensive. The defense of Western Europe was regarded as impractical, and the Pincher, Broiler and Halfmoon plans called for a withdrawal to the Pyrenees, while a strategic air offensive was mounted from bases in the United Kingdom, Okinawa, and the Cairo-Suez or Karachi areas, with ground operations launched from the Middle East aimed at southern Russia. By 1949, priorities had shifted, and the Offtackle plan called for an attempt to hold Soviet forces on the Rhine, followed, if necessary, by a retreat to the Pyrenees, or mounting an Operation Overlord–style invasion of Soviet-occupied Western Europe from North Africa or the United Kingdom. Despite doubts about its viability and effectiveness, a strategic air offensive was regarded as the only means of striking back in the short term. The air campaign plan, which steadily grew in size, called for the delivery of up to 292 atomic bombs and 246,900 short tons (224,000 t) of conventional bombs. It was estimated that 85 percent of the industrial targets would be completely destroyed. These included electric power, shipbuilding, petroleum production and refining, and other essential war fighting industries. About 6.7 million casualties were anticipated, of whom 2.7 million would be killed. There was conflict between the United States Air Force and the United States Navy over naval participation in the strategic bombing effort, and whether it was a worthwhile use of resources. The concept of nuclear deterrence did not figure in the plans.",2022-11-13 06:42:39+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/12561,,,522,2,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In those parts the center of the kingdom is called Lederun (Lejre), in the region of Selon (Sjælland), all the people gathered every nine years in January, that is after we have celebrated the birth of the Lord [Jan 6th], and there they offered to the gods ninety-nine men and just as many horses, along with dogs and cocks— the later being used in place of hawks."" In Hávamál 138-140, when Odin hangs on the “wind-blown tree,” (vindga meiði); he does so as a sacrifice. Pierced with a spear (to drain his blood?), Odin “peers downward” and “takes up” the runes, probably from Mimir’s well. Fjölsvinnsmál 20 refers to Yggdrassil as Mima-meiðr, “Mimir’s Tree.” Here the person who provides Odin the drink is designated as the famous son of Bestla’s father, Bölthorn, i.e. Odin’s own maternal uncle. In symbolic terms, Odin stares down into the vessel which catches his blood, the hlaut-bowl used for divination. Fleck believes this allusive description suggests an inverted (head-down) position. Thus, Odin can look downward, as well as reach downward to take up the runes, assuming his arms were unbound, something he would be unable to do if hung from the neck. The image of the Hanged Man from the Major Arcana of Tarot best illustrates this position:",2022-11-12 21:09:37+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/12519,,,1116,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Today's painting is an illustration of the legend of the baker-cum-smith from the Flemish town of Eclos. He was sought by those who ""did not have the face"" or wanted to change the character. The patient's head was cut off and molded like dough and baked in the oven. And before the ""plastic surgeon"" was finished, a cabbage head was put in the place of the severed organ.

Corradini was commissioned by Raimondo di Sangro to sculpt a memorial for his mother in the Cappella Sansevero in Naples, where the marble sculpture remains today. Modesty was the last in Corradini's series of veiled female nudes. Although the woman’s veil is nearly translucent over her breasts, stomach, and face, in the folds of the veil around her arms, the back of her head, and her hips, there is room for both mystery and the slightest hint of modesty. The veil is immovable, rendering perfect clarity unattainable. In the unattainable exists a longing to see all, longing to seize the veil, discard it, and see what is beneath. Her body draws in the eye, hiding very little of her alluring nature, but the veil still covers her, creating a tension between eroticism and restraint, or perhaps redefining eroticism itself. Even as the viewer studies and wonders about the woman, she gazes aside, as is to make the final decision to refuse to allow the viewer a full picture of who she really is.",2022-11-11 02:12:55+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/12387,,,4024,0,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Debs was in an Atlanta penitentiary, serving a ten-year sentence, when he lost the 1920 presidential election. Two years earlier, Debs, a labor leader, had spoken out against America’s involvement in World War I. He was convicted of violating the Espionage Act of 1917, after the prosecution argued that his antiwar speech obstructed military enrollment. The 1920 loss didn’t come as a surprise to Debs, who had run four times before. His fifth and final run, promoted with a campaign button that read “For President Convict No. 9653,” brought him nearly one million votes, says Claire Jerry, curator of political history at the National Museum of American History. President Harding commuted his sentence in December 1921. https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2019/09/22/socialist-who-ran-president-prison-won-nearly-million-votes/",2022-11-09 18:31:51+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/12301,,,3236,3,28,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In former times, when wars were fought, the weapons were silent in winter. The fighting took place exclusively in the warm months. Because of this misunderstanding, the sign became a symbol for the peace movement - although it is actually more ""related"" to the cemetery than to real peace. The peace inherent in the peace sign is a peace built on violence and injustice, namely the elimination (killing) of all enemies. For when one has killed all enemies, peace = there is peace/ graveyard silence. The ancient Romans called this state Pax Romana. Therefore this symbol designation is more correct, than the above-mentioned.

The war was going around the field, men were mowing. Death leapt from invisible scythes. Death was frightened by my sixteen years, my hesitation was guided by God's hand, and when I fell, I lay inexperienced, a glow was sunk into my face. And who crouched by me to breathe, eyes flickering, filled with war, saw my face, and his fever faltered, the fear melted away, the loud terror was silent. And jump after jump goes out from this silence, in wide waves the attack breaks forth, the warriors grow from the grain and rise, and rise, refreshed by death, to the ramparts of the enemy. So now I have become a plowman. I have plowed in the midst of a battle. I have sown my grain in the cruel killing And brought my harvest young before God. -Hans Baumann",2022-11-08 05:51:38+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/12159,,,564,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study, which aims to prove that dogs recognize people with bad intentions, appeared in the journal Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews. According to the study, dogs recognize whether a person is friendly or mean to their owner. Not only the own owner, but also interhuman behavior dogs seem to observe clearly. And not only that: they also draw their conclusions from it. So, if your dog actively wants to avoid a certain person, you should pay attention. Perhaps your dog has noticed something that has escaped your notice?

The Celts and Germans and Scandinavians had much in common in their religious practices and beliefs, and this is the first serious attempt that has been made to compare them. There are striking resemblances in their ideas about battle-goddesses and protective spirits, holy places, sacrificial rituals, divination and ideas about the Other World; and Myths and Symbols in Pagan Europe poses questions like: do such parallels go back to early times or are they owing to late Viking contact? Hilda Ellis Davidson has worked for many years on pre-Christian Scandinavian and Germanic religion and now compares them with the Celts from the background of previous studies, using evidence from archaeology, iconography, later literature and folklore, in a search for basic patterns which will add to our knowledge of the early peoples in Europe. Aimed at teachers and libraries but also accessible to students of history, religion and Celtic, Norse and German languages and cultures.",2022-11-04 20:28:50+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/11936,,,1000,0,8,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.47353.user.Davidscave.post.11748,1620420179,Davidscave,11748,,"Language is a guide to social reality. Though language is not ordinarily thought of as of essential interest to the students of social science, it powerfully conditions all our thinking about social problems and processes. Human beings do not live in the objective world alone, nor alone in the world of social activity as ordinarily understood, but are very much at the mercy of the particular language which has become the medium of expression for their society. It is quite an illusion to imagine that one adjusts to reality essentially without the use of language and that language is merely an incidental means of solving specific problems of communication or reflection. The fact of the matter is that the real world is to a large extent unconsciously built up on the language habits of the group. No two languages are ever sufficiently similar to be considered as representing the same social reality. The worlds in which different societies live are distinct worlds, not merely the same world with different labels attached.

The tradition is thought to date back to when wives would haul their drunken husbands back from Chiselborough fair, using punkie lanterns - hollowed out mangelwurzels used to ward off evil spirits - as their guide. Later, children joined in the festivities and would go door to door asking for candles, with the implicit threat of pranks for households that did comply. This is one, but definitely not the only, precursor to modern Halloween trick-or-treating.

Mystical beliefs and practices have existed for millennia, but why do we still chase the esoteric? From the beginning of human creativity itself, image-makers have been drawn to these unknown spheres and have created curious artworks that transcend time and place – but what is it that attracts artists to these magical realms? From theosophy and kabbalah, to the zodiac and alchemy; spiritualism and ceremonial magic, to the elements and sacred geometry – The Art of the Occult introduces major occult themes and showcases the artists who have been influenced and led by them. Discover the symbolic and mythical images of the Pre-Raphaelites; the automatic drawing of Hilma af Klint and Madge Gill; Leonora Carrington's surrealist interpretation of myth, alchemy and kabbalah; and much more. Featuring prominent, marginalised and little-known artists, The Art of the Occult crosses mystical spheres in a bid to inspire and delight. Divided into thematic chapters (The Cosmos, Higher Beings, Practitioners), the book acts as an entertaining introduction to the art of mysticism – with essays examining each practice and over 175 artworks to discover. The art of the occult has always existed in the margins but inspired the masses, and this book will spark curiosity in all fans of magic, mysticism and the mysterious.",2022-10-30 05:33:18+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/11612,,,853,0,10,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is based on involution and not upon evolution, in the “memory of a lost divine life”, of a Golden Age. It is not man who descends from the monkey, but the monkey who devolves from man, thus how man has involuted from the divine world, from the god-man. The very earth, the so-called Mother Nature, where the worst cruelties and aberrations happen, is the involution of another Spiritual Earth, which possibly was found within man. Therefore, it is the stratification of implicit vices, of possibilities preexisting with the Total-Man, or better, it is a result of the action of the eternal and destructive Opposing Principle, of Chaos and Nothingness, of Evil, as the Cathars would say.

msg_iteration.47636.user.Davidscave.post.11455,1620420179,Davidscave,11455,,"Operation Plumbbob, conducted between May 28 and October 7, 1957, represented the biggest, longest, and most controversial test series in the history of the Nevada Test Site (NTS). While most Operation Plumbbob tests contributed to the development of warheads for intercontinental and intermediate range missiles, they also tested air defense and antisubmarine warheads with small yields. Operation Plumbbob had the tallest tower tests to date in the U.S. nuclear testing program, as well as high-altitude balloon tests. One nuclear test involved the largest troop maneuver ever associated with U.S. nuclear testing. Approximately 18,000 members of the U.S. armed forces participated in exercises Desert Rock VII and VIII during Operation Plumbbob. Their leaders were interested in knowing how the average foot-soldier would stand up, physically and psychologically, to the rigors of the tactical nuclear battlefield. Studies were conducted of radiation contamination and fallout from a simulated accidental detonation of a weapon; and projects concerning earth motion, blast loading and neutron output were carried out. Nuclear weapons safety experiments were conducted to study the possibility of a nuclear weapon detonation during an accident. On July 26, 1957, a safety experiment, ""PASCAL-A"" was detonated in an unstemmed hole at NTS, becoming the first underground shaft nuclear test. The knowledge gained here would provide data to prevent any nuclear yields in accidents that actually did occur. Weapons were designed so they could not give a nuclear yield even in the event of a plane crash. The first detonation contained underground, RAINIER, was conducted on September 19, 1957, containing all radioactive products underground, thus producing no fallout This test of 1.7 kilotons could be detected around the world by seismologists using ordinary seismic instruments.

msg_iteration.47729.user.Davidscave.post.11355,1620420179,Davidscave,11355,,"""The other day I came across something that puzzled me, in a history book for the 4th grade. In the book one could read that at the beginning of the 20th century there were history books with titles such as ”Our Fatherland's history” and ”the Fatherland's history told for younger children”. The book outlined the use of the word Fatherland.. in a way that clearly bore witness to the fact that this was no longer something we need in a modern history lesson. In short, we teach our children that the Fatherland belongs to the past. But why exactly, I ask? Denmark is an old country. Since the Vikings.. we Danes have been proud of our country. We have stood together and fought against external enemies. Those who did not were traitors.. people were national patriotic- perhaps even nationalistic. You taught your children about fellowship with other Danes, about taking care of your country, appreciating nature, history and your fellow Danes.. We are creating generations of fools.. storyless, rootless.""

The term compositing, comes from video - and film technology. As part of post-production, two or more separately shot image parts are combined to create an overall image. While Photoshop made its debut in the 1980s, photographers had developed techniques to create photomontages as early as the 18th century. For example, a good portrait of Ulysses S. Grant was a rarity. This circa 1902 photo titled ""General Grant at City Point"" appears to show General Ulysses S. Grant posing on a horse with a large number of soldiers in the background, but it is actually a creation of three different photos.",2022-10-25 18:32:11+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/11329,,,5158,1,55,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have nothing like that, because we go only with the mind. Religion is a kind of relationship to the numinous, to that which seizes me, but it is so ""unpopular"", it is not understood at all. When you talk about it, no one understands it. Because people don't even know that they are gripped, because they are gripped by things that don't correspond to any religious concept: one is gripped by sports, another by a room, the third by money, etc. - and these are not religious factors, of course - but the gripping is the same. The religious one is a higher form of grasping; one understands that there one is subject to a higher power. We have lost that category of apprehension."" C. G.

Loss in 2001. The patent was published in 2003, but no one could trace who Loss was. As such, he has been generally perceived as a fictitious person. The patent claims that it’s possible to manipulate a subject’s nervous system by displaying pulsing images on a nearby TV set or computer monitor. The program material can be embedded with the image pulsing, overlaid by a video stream. It further illustrates how electromagnetic fields pulsed within the ideal frequencies can excite the subject’s sensory resonances.

Understandably, this photo gets quite a bit of attention; at first glance, it seems to be a typical example of colonial oppression. However, according to the author, a certain John Kelly PHD, the photo does not show a British colonist forcing a Bengali woman to wear it at all, but a local woman willingly demonstrating her strength to a French colonial administrator of French Indochina. Other pictures from the time also show that carrying Westerners around was actually a lot more comfortable in the colonies than squeezing into a tiny basket on a woman's back.",2022-10-20 16:50:29+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/10962,,,1057,0,12,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was built to commemorate the 100,000 soldiers killed or wounded in the Battle of the Nations. The allied armies of Russia, Prussia, Austria and Sweden won the decisive victory over Napoleon and his allies on German soil at the battle, which raged from October 16 to 19, 1813. The idea for a monument came from poet Ernst Moritz Arndt, who founded the German Patriots' League in 1894. The goal: to collect donations for the construction of a monument. In 1898, the sum was then sufficient to lay the foundation stone. By the way, the Monument to the Battle of the Nations weighs 300,000 tons and is 91 meters high.""",2022-10-19 18:51:00+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/10902,,,5908,6,53,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maybe she wanted to protest silently, maybe she was not aware of what was coming, but maybe she really forgot. The fact is that this revolution cannot be won with a Jeanne d’Arc effect. A revolution will only succeed if the majority of fathers, workers and men really want it. As long as only the young generation and a few do not want to accept it, it will end in suffering. And I also warn against stylizing young women as heroes because the reprisals are guaranteed to be very hard for these women! A revolution needs balls, warriors and a society that stands together, not women and children who cover the cowardice of society with their blood.

The train was long, as it had 8 carriages, and using a regular old camera from a distance would not do it justice. Lawrence built this special camera for it within two months, weighing up to 635 kg.

This series is still considered the birth of ""fake news."" Circulations of The Sun increased dramatically due to the hoax and remained permanently higher than ever before, establishing The Sun as one of the most successful and profitable newspapers. The whole hoax persisted for several weeks after its publication, despite a correction by the editors. Three weeks after the first article, on September 16, 1835, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper announced that ""there is nothing to a life on the moon."" However, the ""Great Moon Hoax"" had already had a decisive influence on the history of mass media, partly because it made clear how easy it is to influence masses.

Completed in 2018, the structure of the angel stands at 27 ft (8.2 m) tall. In order to create the sculpture, 200 knife banks were produced by the Ironworks and amnesties held for individuals to anonymously donate their knives. Knives seized by police were also included, some of which arrived in evidence tubes still with bodily fluids on their surface.

Benczúr’s painting was commissioned for the assembly room of the new city hall on the occasion of the bicentennial, although the work was not completed until 1896. The painting portrays the parade of troops on 3 September, the day after the triumph. The central figure seated on a white horse is Prince Charles of Lorraine, the commander of the military campaign to retake Buda. The soldiers lined up behind him all represent important heroes from the period. Among them are Maximilian II, the elector of Bavaria, János Esterházy, Ádám Batthyány, János Pálffy, István Koháry, and Prince Eugene of Savoy. Standing out in particular are General Dávid Petneházy and also János Fiáth, who is positioned near the general and waving a white flag.

But here's where the problem arises: Since soft tissue decomposes much faster than bone, there is no real way to tell what various ancient creatures actually looked like. If you're not quite convinced of that yet, just take a look at some skulls of modern animals. Most of the time they look like they could belong to infernal creatures rather than house cats or hamsters. This fact even inspired some people to start a new meme format. They tried to imagine how aliens would interpret animal skulls and what they actually look like.

The word ""Cyclops"" literally means ""round-eyed"" or ""circular."" In a famous episode of Homer's Odyssey, the hero Odysseus meets the Cyclops Polyphemus, the son of Poseidon and Thoosa, who lives with his fellow Cyclopes in a distant land. One question that has remained unanswered for a long time is where do Cyclopes actually come from? In my opinion, the origin of the Cyclopes is not based on epic sagas, but on the discovery of a skull of a ""dwarf elephant"". Dwarf elephants also roamed the Luzon and Panay area during the Pleistocene. The eyes on such skulls are not particularly prominent, while the trunk leaves a large ""nasal cavity"" in the center of the head - the ""eye"" of the cyclops.",2022-10-17 04:52:25+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/10724,,,4400,2,49,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most popular examples of this theory are mostly rocks that look like animals, or faces, body parts, plants, etc. This is a normal function of our brain that these storytellers take advantage of. The phenomenon of seeing familiar shapes in objects is called pareidolia, where the brain fills in missing information to create a familiar shape. Everyone has looked at clouds and then seen them take the shape of an animal or a person. Pareidolia is the tendency to impose a meaningful interpretation on a mostly visual stimulus so that you see an object, pattern, or meaning where there really is none.",2022-10-15 08:16:19+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/10574,,,612,1,10,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His wife was Theia, lady of the aither--the shining blue of the sky. Hyperion's name means ""watcher from above"" or ""he who goes above"" from the greek words hyper and iôn. Hyperion was one of four Titan brothers who conspired with Kronos (Cronus) to castrate and depose their father Ouranos. When Sky descended to lie with Earth, Hyperion, Krios (Crius), Koios (Coeus) and Iapetos (Iapetus)--posted at the four corners of the world--seized hold of their father and held him fast while Kronos castrated him with a sickle. In this myth these four Titanes (Titans) personify the great pillars holding heaven and earth apart or the entire cosmos aloft described in Near-Eastern cosmogonies. As the father of the sun and dawn, Hyperion was no doubt regarded as the Titan of the pillar of the east. His brothers Koios, Krios and Iapetos presided respectively over the north, south and west. The Titanes (Titans) were eventually deposed by Zeus and cast into the pit of Tartaros (Tartarus). Hesiod describes this as a void located beneath the foundations of all, where earth, sea and sky have their roots. Here the Titanes shift in cosmological terms from being holders of heaven to bearers of the entire cosmos. According to Pindar and Aeschylus (in his lost play Prometheus Unbound) the Titanes were eventually released from the pit through the clemency of Zeus.",2022-10-15 07:21:38+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/10562,,,650,1,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Binding Words, Don C. Skemer provides the first book-length study of this once-common means of harnessing the magical power of words. Textual amulets were a unique source of empowerment, promising the believer safe passage through a precarious world by means of an ever-changing mix of scriptural quotations, divine names, common prayers, and liturgical formulas. Although theologians and canon lawyers frequently derided textual amulets as ignorant superstition, many literate clergy played a central role in producing and disseminating them. The texts were, in turn, embraced by a broad cross-section of Western Europe. Saints and parish priests, physicians and village healers, landowners and peasants alike believed in their efficacy. Skemer offers careful analysis of several dozen surviving textual amulets along with other contemporary medieval source materials. In the process, Binding Words enriches our understanding of popular religion and magic in everyday medieval life.",2022-10-13 15:39:45+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/10495,,,4095,0,33,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.48663.user.Davidscave.post.10371,1620420179,Davidscave,10371,,"""Darkness to light"" or even ""Dark to light"".... Where does the Q slogan really come from? In Freemasonry, light is a powerful symbol. In fact, it is the most important symbol in their ritual for initiating aspirants. Masonic initiation symbolically brings the new initiate from darkness into light, and symbols form the language of Freemasonry. As Martin Luther King Jr. said, ""Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that."" So when a man becomes a Freemason, the Masonic light that illuminates him as he embarks on his spiritual journey is said to purify his consciousness and enlighten him with Brahma Vidya. Etymologically, Vid is the root of the word Vidya. Vid means light, ya means ""what."" So the meaning of the term ""Vidya"" is ""that which gives light"".",2022-10-11 19:28:37+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/10371,,,484,9,13,1,PeerChannel,1224324472.0,,2022-10-11 19:28:19,2022-10-11,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This book covers a wide range of topics, including the magical texts which circulated in medieval Europe, the attitudes of intellectuals and churchmen to magic, the ways in which magic intersected with other aspects of medieval culture, and the early witch trials of the fifteenth century. In doing so, it offers the reader a detailed look at the impact that magic had within medieval society, such as its relationship to gender roles, natural philosophy, and courtly culture. This is furthered by the book’s interdisciplinary approach, containing chapters dedicated to archaeology, literature, music, and visual culture, as well as texts and manuscripts. The Routledge History of Medieval Magic also outlines how research on this subject could develop in the future, highlighting under-explored subjects, unpublished sources, and new approaches to the topic. It is the ideal book for both established scholars and students of medieval magic.",2022-10-10 21:30:24+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/10311,,,3534,0,18,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also showed several other photos, videos, and views from scientists that suggest the prehistoric shark may still be alive. However, the original old footage of the archived submarine film does not show the presence of such a large creature.

Secondly, it is a fascinating choice for his subject matter: a man holding the head of a woman whose gaze turns people to stone.

Italian sculptor, goldsmith and silversmith, he is considered one of the most important artists of Mannerism, that extravagant and refined style that marked the end of the Renaissance. Restless and violent in nature, he led an adventurous life, marked by conflicts, passions and crimes, for which he was often forced into exile or fleeing. Cosimo I De 'Medici, Duke of Florence and then Grand Duke of Tuscany, between 1537 and 1574 (the year of his death), attracted to his court a large number of artists and writers, including Cellini himself, elevating him to the rank of court sculptor. And it is precisely on that occasion that Cellini designed, among many others, an admirable work still today in the Loggia dei Lanzi, in Piazza della Signoria: the Perseus with the head of Medusa , a project begun in 1545 and completed nine years later. in 1554.",2022-10-10 17:44:09+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/10284,,,501,0,4,1,PeerChannel,1497242922.0,vaultofsecrets,2022-10-10 17:41:58,2022-10-10,https://t.me/vaultofsecrets/10188,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore All is One. 2. Everything in the physical world exists by virtue of the Law of Polarity or Duality. Any idea can be defined in relation to its opposite, such as: male-female, light-dark, sun-moon, spirit-body, and so on. 3. Everything in the physical world is composed of Spirit, Soul, and Body: the Three Alchemic Principles. (In alchemy, these are called Mercury, Sulfur, and Salt.) 4. All alchemical work, whether practical laboratory work or spiritual alchemy, consists of three basic evolutionary processes: separation, purification, and recombination. 5. All matter is composed of four archetypal energies—the four elements of Fire (thermal energy), Water (liquid), Air (gas), and Earth (solid). The knowledge and skillful use of these four energy types is an essential part of alchemical work. 6. The Quintessence, or “Fifth essence,” is contained within the four elements but is not one of them. It is one of the three essential Principles, also called the Philosophic Mercury. 7. Everything moves toward its preordained state of perfection.

MASONRY IN THE REPUBLIC At the end of the Spanish colonial period, Cuban Freemasonry begins a new stage. During all the previous period it had had to struggle to define the limits between Scottishness and symbolism, it had faced political persecutions, and on many occasions it had facilitated conspiratorial activities of the Creoles and, only now, after four years of forced recess, but favored by the new circumstances, could it take care of putting order in its own house and define its destiny. In the magazine La Gran Logia of June 1900 appears an article which, although limited in its objectives, would define the main line of the work they propose to carry out to contribute to the recovery of the country: '... The mission of Freemasonry must be purely advisory, its direct power only reaches its members; its sphere of action in society cannot go, as an auxiliary, beyond education and charity'. Although when the Masonic work was resumed, one of the major difficulties that the members had to solve was the lack of resources, the institution dedicated itself to create decent conditions for its facilities and undertook various works that responded to the exposed interests. In 1917 the Masons saved from bankruptcy the asylum for children and the elderly La Misericordia, which still exists today under the name of Hogar Nacional Masonico Llanso, and later took on works such as the support of the Casa de Beneficencia de Matanzas and the José Maria Casal Asylum for children, as well as the creation of the Auxilio Masonico, as a way of helping the relatives of deceased Masons, which still exists today.

The U.S.-military-backed Bolivian forces captured Guevara on October 8 while battling his band of guerillas in Bolivia and executed him the following day. His hands were cut off as proof of death and his body was buried in an unmarked grave. In 1997, Guevara’s remains were found and sent back to Cuba, where they were reburied in a ceremony attended by President Fidel Castro and thousands of Cubans. https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/cuba-intelligence/2020-10-09/che-guevara-cia-mountains-bolivia",2022-10-09 08:13:18+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/10173,,,4544,1,36,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though officially lasting only 11 years, the powerful spell and shadow cast by the Illuminati still looms in the present day, where its influence can be seen in current conspiracy beliefs and actions by powerful individuals working in the shadows. The original Order of the Illuminati was founded by Bavarian professor Adam Weishaupt in 1776. Although the order was banned and brought down by the Bavarian Elector in 1787--when he became aware of the extent to which it had infiltrated the courts, schools, and his own administration--its legend and deep influence lives on to this day. Charting the rise and fall of this infamous order, this book--first published in French in 1915 and never before available in English--remains the definitive history of the Order of the Bavarian Illuminati. It also offers a revealing look at the world that spawned and shaped it: a ceaseless ferment of revolutionary and occult ideas and the ceaseless attempts by crown and church to suppress them. Other secret societies that shared the stage with the Illuminati during these years include the Templar Strict Observance, von Hund’s Templar Freemasonry, and other Masonic lodges the Illuminati targeted to subvert for their own purposes. Many of the documents the author consulted for the writing of this book were destroyed during the two World Wars, making this book the only surviving record of many of the order’s secrets. The author explains the Bavarian Illuminati’s grades, rituals, and ceremonies as well as its fundamental philosophies. He paints vivid portraits of the leaders of the order, including Weishaupt, Baron Knigge, and Xavier von Zwack. He reveals how Weishaupt early on decided to subvert the existing German Freemason Lodge as a shortcut to gain esoteric hegemony over the occult world, all in order to extend Illuminati influence into the society at large and the government. The author also provides extensive detail of the order’s eventual destruction by the Bavarian government. In addition to its revelation of little-known secrets of the Illuminati Order, the author also sheds new light on much of the occult life of this time, including the activities of figures such as Cagliostro and Mirabeau and other active groups such as Freemason chapters, the Rosicrucians, and the Martinists.",2022-10-08 13:41:42+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/10071,,,969,0,21,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The book includes over 30 years of subsequent research into the psychological and social factors which result in immoral acts being committed by otherwise moral people. It also examines the prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib in 2003, which has similarities to the Stanford experiment.

The nuckelavee is kept in confinement during the summer months by the Mither o' the Sea, an ancient Orcadian spirit, and the only one able to control it. Orcadian folklore had a strong Scandinavian influence, and it may be that the nuckelavee is a composite of a water horse from Celtic mythology and a creature imported by the Norsemen. As with similar malevolent entities such as the kelpie, it possibly offered an explanation for incidents that islanders in ancient times could not otherwise understand.",2022-10-06 19:09:12+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/9921,,,538,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""[the Cossacks] elected their own chieftains or atamans, to whom they gave as a sceptre a mace, the ensign of command. In time of peace, the ataman had no other authority but that of persuasion, but in time of war, his power was absolute and despotic"" (Mérimée, 1853). In 1917, in the Bolshevik revolution, Ataman Kaledin [photo 8] said, ""I take upon myself... all the power concerning the region of the Don,"" until, ""the restoration of order in Russia."" Symbolically the marshal’s baton is a sign of capability rather than birth or ancestry, a question of whether or not the candidate has a natural suitability for those higher positions of leadership.

msg_iteration.49193.user.Davidscave.post.9816,1620420179,Davidscave,9816,,"Cult of Tree Worship The cult of tree worship is as old or older than civilization, in fact almost the first objects to be worshipped were trees. In India this was found on a seal discovered at Mohenjodaro, (now in Pakistan), which depicts Aswattha (Ficus religiosa) being worshipped. This seal dates back to the 3rd or 4th millennium B.C. The worship of trees in India is understandable as the trees not only provided shade in the hot scorching summers, food, and medicine and fuel but the forests meant rain, which was essential for a purely agricultural economy. The trees being beneficial to humanity, to protect them became a Religion for people and the trees were converted into the Abode of Spirits, the ‘Vana-devattas’(a forest deity). To cut down a tree meant depriving the Spirit of its home. So if a tree was to be cut down, special prayers for Forgiveness of the tree spirit were performed. Invariably it is not the tree that is worshipped but the spirits residing in them.",2022-10-05 18:29:31+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/9816,,,531,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two decades later, William Neville and his magician were arrested by Thomas Cromwell for having engaged in a treasonous combination of magic practices and prophecy surrounding the death of William&;s older brother, Lord Latimer, and the king. In The Magic of Rogues, Frank Klaassen and Sharon Hubbs Wright present the legal documents about and open a window onto these fascinating investigations of magic practitioners in early Tudor England. Set side by side with sixteenth- and seventeenth-century texts that describe the sorts of magic those practitioners performed, these documents are translated, contextualized, and presented in language accessible to nonspecialist readers. Their analysis reveals how magicians and cunning folk operated in extended networks in which they exchanged knowledge, manuscripts, equipment, and even clients; foregrounds magicians&; encounters with authority in ways that separate them from traditional narratives about witchcraft and witch trials; and suggests that the regulation and punishment of magic in the Tudor period were comparatively and perhaps surprisingly gentle. Incorporating the study of both intellectual and legal sources, The Magic of Rogues presents a well-rounded picture of illicit learned magic in early Tudor England. Engaging and accessible, this book will appeal to anyone seeking to understand the intersection of medieval legal history, religion, magic, esotericism, and Tudor history.",2022-10-04 20:19:20+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/9784,,,629,0,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Russians were able to gain control of the city of Kars but this would later be relinquished back to the Ottoman Empire. The war had proven to be longer and bloodier than expected which, for Britain especially, had led to disgruntlement back home. Nevertheless, the ally threat remained in Russian territories until the Congress of Paris began on 1 February 1856. Eventually, on 30 March 1856, the Treaty of Paris was signed officially bringing an end to the war. The key results of the peace negotiations saw Russia return Kars and “all other parts of the Ottoman territory of which the Russian troops were in possession” back to the Ottoman Empire. The Russians also agreed to the Black Sea remaining demilitarised. The allies – Britain, France, Sardinia and the Ottoman Turks – meanwhile agreed to restore the Russian towns and ports they occupied, including Sevastopol and Balaklava. Much of the treaty, particularly the bans on Russia having any naval forces in the Black Sea, was designed to re-establish the peace that had been created by the Congress of the Vienna in 1815 and had lasted for almost 40 years prior to the start of the Crimean War.",2022-10-04 18:39:47+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/9765,,,560,3,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The three-year conflict gets its name from the fact that it was mainly fought on the Crimean Peninsula, an area in the south of modern day Ukraine as of March 2014 Ukraine is in dispute with Russia over ownership of the territory) that sits within the Black Sea. The war saw Britain, France, Sardinia and the Ottoman Empire ally against, and ultimately defeat, Russia. It is a war that is remembered for the poor leadership, communication and organisation of the allied forces (often epitomised by The Charge of the Light Brigade), which resulted in a bloody and prolonged conflict. What had been anticipated to be a short war in which the superior training, experience and technology possessed by the military forces of France and Great Britain were meant to quickly and conclusively dominate, ultimately proved to be a long, drawn-out affair.

The truth is a bit stickier. Lick’s job was to develop the underlying computer and networking technology necessary to fight modern wars... For instance, documents show that in March 1962, he attended an influential US Army symposium that convened in Washington, DC, to discuss how behavioral science and computer technology could be used to better wage “limited war” and counterinsurgency. There, Lick was part of a working group dedicated to crafting a US Army counterinsurgency research program that could meet a “multidimensional Communist challenge—in paramilitary warfare, in psychological warfare, and in the conventional and nuclear field.” ...Fundamentally, his vision for a distributed interactive computing network is not very different from what the Internet looks like today...""

He taught and conducted research at the Collegium Romanum in Rome for most of his life. Kircher published a large number of detailed monographs on a wide range of subjects including Egyptology, geology, medicine, mathematics, and music theory. More than 150 years before Jean-François Champollion, he attempted to decipher Egyptian hieroglyphics. Friedrich Kittler describes Kircher as ""a kind of scientific fire department of the pope: With special orders and special powers, he was always on the spot when new scientific territory had to be entered, but also defended in the name of the church. Kircher was indeed ahead of his time, which can be seen in particular in his influence on acoustics, astronomy, mechanics and color theory.

He was found to have accepted bribes in court and to have given an unfair verdict. As a consequence, the king ordered that he be arrested and flayed alive for his corruption. Before pronouncing the sentence, the king asked Sisamnes whom he wanted to appoint as his successor. Sisamnes, in his greed, chose his son Otanes. The king agreed and appointed Otanes to replace his father. He then passed judgment and ordered that the skin removed by Sisamnes be used to cushion the seat on which the new judge would sit in court, to remind him of the possible consequences of corruption. Otanes, in his reflections, always had to remember that he always sat on the skin of his executed father. thanks to https://t.me/benshresearch",2022-10-02 18:07:58+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/9622,,,775,0,11,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Official sources at the time attributed his death to natural causes, but evidence later emerged suggesting that he had been strangled on the orders of the military government.

The part that it is accessible for visitors includes the military fortification partially and the sacred area of the former city, which presents similarities with Machu Picchu. The fortress is the location of very important archaeological discoveries, such as gold jewelry and the highest amount of iron that was discovered outside the Roman Empire. Also, it is known for its high spiritual energy drawn from rituals that were performed there and from the mountain itself.

The slave traders found a way around this: 10% of the Old Testament and 50% of the New Testament were left of the canonical text. As a result, the ""Slave Bible"" was born. The Book of Exodus, how Moses led the Hebrews out of Egyptian slavery, was completely eliminated, but the story of Joseph's captivity and enslavement was preserved, apparently as a useful example of humility. There is no apostle Peter's letter to the Galatians, the phrase ""There is neither slave nor free ... for you are all one in Christ"" might have led the slaves to the wrong thoughts and conclusions. But there is Paul's letter to the Ephesians, because ""Servants shall be obedient to their masters"" fit perfectly with the general line.",2022-10-01 08:57:43+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/9467,,,523,0,8,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Katherine Luongo discusses the emergence of imperial networks of knowledge about witchcraft. She then demonstrates how colonial concerns about witchcraft produced an elaborate body of jurisprudence about capital crimes. The book analyzes the legal wrangling that produced the Witchcraft Ordinances in the 1910s, the birth of an anthro-administrative complex surrounding witchcraft in the 1920s, the hotly contested Wakamba Witch Trials of the 1930s, the explosive growth of legal opinion on witch-murder in the 1940s, and the unprecedented state-sponsored cleansings of witches and Mau Mau adherents during the 1950s. A work of anthropological history, this book develops an ethnography of Kamba witchcraft or uoi.",2022-09-29 05:27:52+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/9311,,,666,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The woodcut was in black, green, and brown, printed from twenty-three blocks on three combined sheets. The word “metamorphose” becomes a springboard for the images. Escher describes the following: “Placed horizontally and vertically in the plane, with the letters o and m as points of intersection the words are gradually transformed into a mosaic of black and white squares which in turn develop into reptiles. Now the rhythm changes...by and by each each figure simplifies into a regular hexagon. At this point an association of ideas occurs: hexagons are reminiscent of the cells of a honeycomb, and no sooner has this thought occurred than a bee larva begins to stir in every cell... and so forth, continuing with images of birds, fish and even a city, and then back to abstract shapes and letters.”",2022-09-28 20:06:49+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/9287,,,459,0,3,1,PeerChannel,1224324472.0,,2022-09-28 19:57:30,2022-09-28,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.49717.user.Davidscave.post.9264,1620420179,Davidscave,9264,,"The late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are known as the Age of Enlightenment, a time of science and reason. But in this illuminating book, Paul Monod reveals the surprising extent to which Newton, Boyle, Locke, and other giants of rational thought and empiricism also embraced the spiritual, the magical, and the occult. Although public acceptance of occult and magical practices waxed and waned during this period they survived underground, experiencing a considerable revival in the mid-eighteenth century with the rise of new antiestablishment religious denominations. The occult spilled over into politics with the radicalism of the French Revolution and into literature in early Romanticism. Even when official disapproval was at its strongest, the evidence points to a growing audience for occult publications as well as to subversive popular enthusiasm. Ultimately, finds Monod, the occult was not discarded in favor of “reason” but was incorporated into new forms of learning. In that sense, the occult is part of the modern world, not simply a relic of an unenlightened past, and is still with us today",2022-09-27 18:32:37+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/9264,,,11413,0,64,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
