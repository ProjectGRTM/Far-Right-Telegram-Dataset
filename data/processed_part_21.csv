msg_iteration.68.user.MUSSOLINIAN2.post.223,2124942545,MUSSOLINIAN2,223,,"RURAL ITALY Throughout its three civilisations, Italy has been essentially rural. Over the millennia, the lineage has drawn the energies of life and the resources of autonomy from the earth. Ever since consular and imperial Rome founded the colonies of legionaries, national prosperity always coincided with agricultural development. At the same time, political decline was always accompanied, or preceded, by the decline of agriculture. The fascist regime, resuming the ways of ancient greatness, strengthened the morality of rural life, restored prestige to the men of the fields, and placed agriculture as the basis for growth. The Duce's rural directives are inspired by historical reasons, the value of which will be alive and active even in future generations. 1. - The earth's resources are first and foremost a condition of freedom and a force for independence. The sober and frugal Italian, when he is sure of bread, is sure of life, and, as we have seen, he can cope even with monstrous coalitions. The earth never abandons those who are faithful to it. 2. - Life in the fields is a life of physical and spiritual health. Oxygen and solar radiation make the body resistant. In rural areas the family has the most favorable conditions for security and development. While industrial and urban civilization takes women away from the hearth and children, rurality makes women the queen of the home and family. In all the centers touched by the decadence of industrial and urban civilization, coffins outnumber cradles, morality decays and the race becomes insenile. Italy's demographic strength is still and always in the countryside. 3. - In agriculture and in the provisions that regulate rural life, from the wheat battle to the law on storage, Italy has achieved brilliant records. Italian genius also asserted itself in this field, precisely in the period of most severe difficulty, while agriculture in all states and on all continents was depressed and humiliated by an inexorable crisis. Elsewhere the prices of the grain market do not reward the efforts and barely compensate for the expenses. The Italian farmer, on the other hand, is sure of a profitable price, is emancipated from the slavery of speculation, and is freed from market fluctuations. Italy has developed the chosen seeds, which are popular abroad and fuel a valuable export. 4. - A people of bold pioneers and intelligent farmers, the Italians began the agricultural redemption of Ethiopia in the first year of the empire. Few other peoples in the world would have had the vital drive to face the terrible effort of opening thousands of kilometers of roads under the tropical sun and clearing barbaric lands, four thousand and eight thousand kilometers from the motherland. This vital drive is a title of record, a patent of youth and a pride of the lineage. In the so-called great democracies the unemployed live of indolence and subsidies in the shadow of deserted factories, refusing to colonize the captured empires, and the bourgeoisie pays the annual tribute to the unemployed to obtain a social quiet which is stasis and decadence. Fascism, which is youth, which is faith in life and joy of work, faces the most gigantic undertaking of our period in the colonization of Ethiopia, an undertaking which will last generations and will constitute; despite Geneva, a proud title in history.",2024-05-25 15:10:40+00:00,https://t.me/MUSSOLINIAN2/223,,,346,0,6,1,PeerChannel,2063878996.0,MUSSOLINIAN3,2024-05-25 15:10:22,2024-05-25,https://t.me/MUSSOLINIAN3/95,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.75.user.MUSSOLINIAN2.post.216,2124942545,MUSSOLINIAN2,216,,"The myth of Mussolini’s Jewish mistress and “Kosher fascism” Many often site the story of Mussolini’s supposed Jewish mistress (Margherita Sarfatti) as an attempt to delegitimize the moral integrity of the Italian Fascist regime and to push the narrative that Mussolini was a hypocrite that was unconcerned with any Jewish question or Fascist ideal. This story of the Jewish mistress is repeated by anti-fascists and misinformed nationalists alike. Her presence as a journalist in the early years of the Fascist regime is often used by some to highlight the supposed Jewish influence in Italian fascism, usually as another angle of slander to display Italian Fascism as an inconsistent and hypocritical ideology. Regarding this supposed affair with Margherita Sarfatti, this is a claim which derives from Sarfatti herself. Apart from her own accusation, there is no evidence whatsoever of her being Mussolini’s mistress. Sarfatti was an embittered Jewess who after the Italian anti-Semitic laws of 1938 leveled accusations of adultery against Mussolini and outrageously attributed to herself the role of having ""created Fascism"". Sarfatti's role in Fascist history is, due to her Jewish background, greatly exaggerated by modern writers. In her years as a supporter of the Fascist Party she contributed nothing to Fascism outside of editing a newspaper favorable to Fascism and to the Party, a role no more important than what was performed by hundreds of other writers and newspaper editors. Her only legitimate claim to fame, her authorship of a biography favorable towards Mussolini and to Fascism (The Life of Benito Mussolini, 1925), which by that time was an already established and widely accepted ideology, the product of Mussolini's genius, and nothing to do with Sarfatti. Her own exaggerated claims as regards her role in shaping Fascism, and her slanderous assertions of carrying on an early love affair with Mussolini, are the product of strong bitterness towards Mussolini and the Fascist Party for enacting anti-Semitic laws in 1938. Additionally, already in 1932 she had been fired and not allowed to write articles in Fascist newspapers. All this, together with Sarfatti's delusion of an early ""Kosher Fascism"" of which she considered herself to be a part of, and of a later supposedly ""corrupt Fascism"", which she felt betrayed by, and falsely claimed was the product of German National Socialist influence. Sarfatti's exaggerated, mythical, and slanderous claims regarding her role in Fascist history (such as claiming to have written articles in Mussolini's name, claiming to have been the theorist behind the March on Rome, claiming to have been Mussolini's personal adviser who helped shape Fascist ideology, etc.) and libels against Mussolini's character (such as claiming to have had love affairs with him during his marriage) are found mainly in her own post-war writings and testimonies, and it is primarily from these that modern writers base their own libels, exaggerations and gossip, treating them as if they were dogma. It is also worth noting that Sarfatti had converted to Christianity and was baptized Catholic in the 1920's, although her doctrinal orthodoxy and sincerity can be debated, especially given her behaviour. Her later actions puts her Jewishness and insincerity on full display. Mussolini himself alluded to the accusations of his extramarital affairs in his book ""Story of a Year” from 1944: ""Suddenly, the floodgates of gossip were thrown open, and the five percent of truth was embroidered with wild fancies of all sorts which, however, did not fail to excite the curiosity of the mob... It was necessary to make an end of me, first of all by a silence of the grave, and then by ridicule… 'Keep on slandering, some of the mud will stick.' And there is no doubt that some did stick."" The tale of Mussolini’s supposed Jewish mistress has no legitimacy whatsoever, and is on-par with the tales of Hitler supposedly having sexual relations with his niece or being partially Jewish: completely slanderous and baseless propaganda.",2024-05-09 15:50:20+00:00,https://t.me/MUSSOLINIAN2/216,,,230,1,7,1,PeerChannel,2063878996.0,MUSSOLINIAN3,2024-05-09 15:50:11,2024-05-09,https://t.me/MUSSOLINIAN3/88,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.82.user.MUSSOLINIAN2.post.209,2124942545,MUSSOLINIAN2,209,,"Mussolini did not fill the Italian military with “Fascist cronies” It has been claimed by many that Mussolini made an effort to fill the Italian military with his own Fascist “cronies” without concern for merit. This idea that the Italian military was ran by incompetent fascist cronies is often used as an explanation for any perceived Italian incompetence or military inadequacy, and as an explanation for the Italians being ill-prepared for World War II. The idea that inadequate fascist generals were at fault for Italy being ill-prepared for World War II is completely incorrect. Firstly, with the slightest amount of research, you will find that a large portion of the military leaders were not even fascist, mostly being holdovers from the pre-fascist era, as Mussolini did not have full military powers and only received shared military powers with the king after March 30, 1938, as the “First Marshal of the Empire.” As Mussolini was not the head of state, his ability to influence the military was limited, and he was only given military powers in 1938, a mere two years before the war would begin. The challenge to completely reform the military high command was is a daunting task to say the least, and Mussolini most definitely was not capable of replacing everyone was loyal fascists, an action that the king, who was still the head of state, and who still shared military powers with Mussolini, would never have agreed to. It is true, however, that there was a significant number of loyal fascists who rose in the ranks of the military under Fascism, however, this is hardly a surprise given the fact that many of the committed Fascists were ex-soldiers (something that the fascist regime was very proud of) so it’s only natural that these former soldiers would seek positions in the military complex. However, whatever struggles that the Italian military faced in World War II had absolutely nothing to do with fascist influence or nepotism, in fact we effectively have firsthand accounts of the contrary. The most highly esteemed units of the Italian army were that of the MVSN or Blackshirts, specifically the elite special forces of Battaglioni M. These units were composed entirely of men ideologically devoted to Fascism. These elite units were filled with and commanded by devoted fascists, and were often compared to the Waffen SS for their elite and professional nature in every campaign they partook in. If “fascist nepotism” was the reason for any struggles that the Italian military faced, we should not expect this sort of performance from units that were entirely composed of loyal fascists. In fact, it seems that if loyalty was an issue for the Italian military, it surely wasn’t the issue of men being chosen out of loyalty to Fascism and without merit, rather the problem appears to be with generals who were holdovers from the pre-fascist era that had absolutely no loyalty to the regime or the military objectives of their country. Most of these generals would defect to the allies in 1943. In August 1941, Mussolini would go as far as to say this in a conversation with Hitler: ”Tell me what you would do if you had officers who had doubts about the regime and its ideologies... and who said, while you spoke about your ideology or reason of State, that they are monarchists and that they owe loyalty only to the King?” In conclusion, the narrative that “fascist nepotism” caused Italy’s military failures completely falls apart with the slightest amount of research and is nothing more than postwar revisionist propaganda.",2024-04-28 11:11:02+00:00,https://t.me/MUSSOLINIAN2/209,,,272,3,3,1,PeerChannel,2063878996.0,MUSSOLINIAN3,2024-04-28 11:10:51,2024-04-28,https://t.me/MUSSOLINIAN3/82,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He then tries to make a connection to this perceived “ruthless” mindset of fascism and the Italian treatment of its colonies during various pacification campaigns, specifically mentioning Somalia. Now it is beyond my comprehension how this is connected in anyway (teaching White kids to shoot rifles means Black people die in Africa somehow) In his attempt to villainize the Italians for their pacification campaign he completely ignores the fact that various other colonial powers engaged in similar, if not harsher pacification campaigns using similar methods. The Italians are often ridiculed for using mustard gas in certain pacification campaigns, when various other colonial powers were also using mustard gas. The British for example used chemical weapons in the 1920 revolt in Iraq and were producing chemical weapons well until the late 1930s. He tries to argue that the Italians were extremely harsh do the native Africans, but he completely neglects the massive investments that the Italians were making in modernizing the colonial economies (investments larger than in any other colonial power) The Italians also actively collaborated with local African rulers before and after the Ethiopian campaign, one only needs to search the names of Abba Jofir, Hailu Tekle Haymanot, and Haile Selassie Gugsa as examples.

The European peoples, including those who have moved to other continents, are almost all considered as belonging to the Aryan race. The primitive Italian population can be considered native to our soil; their traces can be seen dating back to very distant prehistoric times. This native population was then, in later times, joined by groups of people of white race, who came from the sea or through the Alpine passes. The unity of the Italian race was realized in full by Rome, which arose providentially as the nucleus around which our civilization would be organized. Rome was able to fulfill this function because its inhabitants were workers and warriors, as Virgil describes them: ""We are a tough race. We take our new-born sons to the river, to harden them in the ice-cold waves. Our boys are keen at hunting and overcoming the forests. Their pastimes are horse-taming and archery. They grow up content with little, strengthened by struggle, tilling the earth, and in war they break down the enemy's walls. Our life is worn away with iron: with the lance of war we sting the side of the young ox.

As tree branches depart from the trunk, so within the human species there are distinct races. When we generally speak of race, we are referring to a biological reality, that is to say, a human group whose individuals have a set of similar characteristics, such as the color of the skin, the shape of the skull, the type of hair, etc. Race is formed and delimitated by the constant inheritance of those characteristics which distinguish it from all the others. However, in addition to inheriting physical or biological characteristics, moral characteristics are also inherited in race, that is to say, that set of instincts, inclinations, attitudes and qualities that make up the human personality. Scientists disagree about the number and denomination of human races. The simplest and clearest system is the synthetic one, which classifies humanity into white, yellow and black races; or europid, mongoloid and negroid. Each of these great races or categories is divided into a variable and difficult to ascertain number of sub-races, which are not always easily distinguishable from each other. The tripartite classification—that is to say, the one that reduces the main human races to three—in general corresponds with the text of the Bible, which traces the population of the Earth to the division and dispersion of the descendants of Noah, namely the families of Shem, Ham, Japheth. The physical and spiritual differences existing between the main races, the secondary races and the sub-races of the same race, are due to a considerable number of factors, not all of which are known. The evident inferiority of some races, and especially of that which is unanimously called the Negroid race, is attributed to a progressive decline over very long periods of time. Other scientists attribute this inferiority to an arrest of development. However, it is sufficient to note that there are currently very great differences between the human races, despite their common origin.

But God and victory are two shining conquests of the spirit.” -Benito Mussolini (20 November, 1944)",2024-02-15 17:48:31+00:00,https://t.me/MUSSOLINIAN2/149,,,305,0,4,1,PeerChannel,2063878996.0,MUSSOLINIAN3,2024-02-15 17:45:16,2024-02-15,https://t.me/MUSSOLINIAN3/43,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If only he was alive, I'd do anything to talk to him about what happened to our political landscape after him! One day, he heard a loud voice, although he didn't see who it came from. — If you want to talk to Mussolini, follow that road, follow the staircase and knock on the door. You'll get what you want.

Don't you know these doors cannot be crossed by the body, but only by the spirit? — I'm after Benito Mussolini. — Get out, there's nobody of this name here. The ugly face slammed the door shut, and man then followed the road, that got even smaller, and arrived at a marble staircase. He knocked on the fine wooden door, and an angelic face came to meet him. – What do you seek? These doors are not supposed to be crossed by the body, but only by the spirit. — I'm after Benito Mussolini. — He's not here. Try asking further on the road.

In Russia 80% of the Soviet leaders are Jews. In Budapest 17 out of the 22 people's commissars are Jews. Might it not be that Bolshevism is the vendetta of Jewry against Christianity? It is a subject certainly worth pondering. It is entirely possible that Bolshevism will drown in the blood of a pogrom of catastrophic proportions. World finance is in the hands of the Jews. Whoever possesses the nations banks controls their politics. Behind the puppets of Paris stand the Rothschilds, the Warburgs, the Schiffs, the Guggenheims, who are of the same blood as the masters of St. Petersburg and Budapest. Race does not betray race. Bolshevism is defended by international plutocracy. That is the essential truth. International plutocracy, dominated and controlled by the Jews, has a supreme interest in hastening all of Russian life through its process of molecular disintegration to the point of paroxysm.

When, in parliament, I delivered my first speech of November 16, 1922, after the Fascist revolution, I concluded by invoking the assistance of God in my difficult task. Well, this sentence of mine seemed to be out of place! In the Italian parliament, a field of action for Italian Masonry, the name of God had been banned for a long time. Not even the Popular party — the so-called Catholic party — had ever thought of speaking of God. In Italy, a political man did not even turn his thoughts to the Divinity. And, even if he had ever thought of doing so, political opportunism and cowardice would have deterred him, particularly in a legislative assembly. It remained for me to make this bold innovation! And in an intense period of revolution! What is the truth! It is that a faith openly professed is a sign of strength.

Many of these interviews were published or re-published in his official newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia. The infamous “Talks with Mussolini” with Emil Ludwig, however, never appeared in the Duce's newspaper and was never publicly acknowledged by Mussolini, as Emil Ludwig did not faithfully transcribe the words of Mussolini. Instead, the Jewish journalist altered many of the Duce's words, falsified entire passages and inserted many of his own anti-Fascist opinions into the book. The Duce attempted to prevent the publication of the work, but he was unable to stop it. In 1932 an Italian edition of the book was published by Mondadori under the title “Colloqui con Mussolini.” The book and its author was ultimately banned by the Fascist government. According to Fascist secretary Gaetano Polverelli, the Head of the Press Office, Mussolini was very angered and appalled by the book, he ordered to cease its printing immediately. In March, April and June 1932 the Press Office three times warned Italian newspapers to ignore Ludwig's book. With the exception of the Fascist journal L'Impero, which published an article on June 18, 1932 attacking Ludwig and Mondadori as profiteers, the Italian Fascist press remained silent on the matter, so as not to bring any unnecessary attention to Ludwig's fraudulent work. After some months, the printing eventually came to a halt; thus the book remained virtually unknown in Italy until after the war, when the same Mondadori republished the book in 1950. However, the book was widely-diffused in the English-speaking world and in Germany, and members of the NSDAP became quite vocal; National Socialist journalists promptly responded and published several articles exposing book as a hoax. The most important was an article entitled Das Mussolini-Geschäft des Emil Ludwig Cohn, published in Nationalsozialistischen Korrespondenz by the Roman correspondent Friedrich C. Willis. Writing under the the pseudonym Georg Heinzmann, he proclaimed ""This is not our Mussolini!"" (“Dies ist nicht unser Mussolini“). Despite being exposed as a hoax and banned some eighty years ago, the book still continues to circulate today as if it were authentic.

This book is the origin of the infamous and widely quoted supposed statement from Mussolini “Race is a feeling not a reality, 95% at least is a feeling” However, there are several amounts of scholarly works that question the authenticity of these “talks” that record these alleged conversations that were held in Palazzo di Venezia in Rome, being held almost daily for an hour at a time between March 23 and April 4, 1932. 1. ""Fascist Voices: An Intimate History of Mussolini's Italy"" by Christopher Duggan: Although not solely focused on ""Talks with Mussolini,"" Duggan discusses the challenges and limitations of relying on published conversations. He raises doubts about the authenticity and accuracy of the book in reconstructing Mussolini's discussions and views. 2. ""Mussolini"" by Denis Mack Smith: In this comprehensive biography of Benito Mussolini, Mack Smith examines various aspects of Mussolini's life and rule. While not exclusively targeting ""Talks with Mussolini,"" Mack Smith critically evaluates the reliability of published conversations in general, including those attributed to Mussolini. 3. ""The Bad Popes"" by E.R. Chamberlin: Although primarily focused on the papacy, Chamberlin briefly discusses and questions the authenticity of ""Talks with Mussolini"" in relation to other historical conversations. He raises doubts about the accuracy of the book's contents. 4. ""War in Italy 1943-1945"" by Richard Lamb: While this book primarily covers the military aspects of the Italian campaign during World War II, Lamb discusses the challenges of reconstructing historical conversations. He questions the veracity of the conversations presented in ""Talks with Mussolini."" 5. ""Mussolini Unleashed, 1939-1941: Politics and Strategy in Fascist Italy's Last War"" by MacGregor Knox: In this book, Knox questions the authenticity of ""Talks with Mussolini"" and highlights the lack of verifiable sources and evidence supporting its claims. 6. ""Mussolini and Fascist Italy"" by Martin Blinkhorn: Blinkhorn discusses the limitations of ""Talks with Mussolini"" as a historical source and emphasizes the need for caution when using it to understand Mussolini's thoughts and actions. 7. ""Benito Mussolini: A Biography"" by Richard J. B. Bosworth: Bosworth critically examines various sources, including ""Talks with Mussolini,"" and raises doubts about their reliability. He highlights the challenges of reconstructing accurate conversations and emphasizes the need to corroborate information from multiple sources. 8. ""A History of Fascism, 1914-1945"" by Stanley Payne: Payne discusses the limitations of ""Talks with Mussolini"" and emphasizes the importance of using multiple sources to gain a comprehensive understanding of Mussolini and fascism. For the reasons above, it is clear that these “talks” are not reliable enough to use as a primary source on the true beliefs of Benito Mussolini on race and antisemitism.

Such instances, though still rare, already occurred in the Italian colonies of Eritrea and Somalia. Mussolini’s state of mind was revealed to Baron Pompeo Aloisi, who when he called on the Duce on April 2, 1934, found him “very upset” by his discovery of a book, Amore Nero (Black Love), that dealt with a love affair between an Italian and a black woman. Mussolini had the book immediately withdrawn from circulation. On August 5, 1936, only several months after the conquest of Ethiopia, a decree was issued outlining the system of racial separation that would now char- acterize Italian East Africa. Beginning with the fundamental provision that “the lives of whites and blacks should be completely separate in Italian East Africa,” it went on to specify the details of this program: “gradual separation of the habi- tations of nationals and indigents”; “avoidance of all familiarity between the two races”; segregation of public space; and the end of “madamismo” (concubines) and “sciarmuttismo” (biracial children). The police were instructed to enforce these provisions with “extreme rigor,” and anyone who was so bold as to live with or act married to a native would be deported. Until the anticipated arrival of Italian women in Africa created the conditions appropriate for proper family life, brothels staffed by Italian prostitutes were set up for the Italian soldiers. Not surprisingly, natives were absolutely forbidden to patronize them.",2023-12-19 04:19:56+00:00,https://t.me/MUSSOLINIAN2/14,,,4986,0,81,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They will even claim that Italian racism and antisemitism was simply imported from the Germans in an attempt to please Hitler. None of these claims could be further from the truth, let’s see what Mussolini has to say on the subject: “A Jewish problem exists, and it is no longer confined to that shadowy sphere.” -Benito Mussolini, The Zionists, 1928 “I have been a racist since 1921. I don't know how they can think I'm imitating Hitler, we must give Italians a sense of race.” -Benito Mussolini, Claretta Petacci’s Diary “However, for Italy - as well as for other countries inhabited by people of the White race - it is a matter of life or death. It is a matter of knowing whether the civilization of the white man is destined to perish in the face of the growing number of yellow and black races.” -Benito Mussolini, Is The White Race Dying? 1934 “In addition, a system of apartheid was introduced involving segregation in public places and an April 1937 law made sexual relations between whites and blacks a crime punishable by up to five years in prison. A popular Fascist song was ‘Faccetta nera’ (Little Black Face) about a slave girl freed by Italian soldiers so she can go to Rome and wear a black shirt. Eventually, Mussolini banned the song and ordered Badoglio to punish Italian soldiers guilty of “sexual relations with native girls."" -Nicholas Farrel, Mussolini: A New Life “We Fascists acknowledge the existence of races, their differences and their hierarchy. But this does not mean that we present ourselves to the world as the embodiment of the White race in a war against other races; and we do not intend to make ourselves the preachers of exclusivism and racial hatred.” -Benito Mussolini, The Irrefutable Fact, 1935 “The forerunner and justifier of anti-semitism is always and everywhere the same: the Jew, whenever he becomes overbearing, as he so often does.” -Benito Mussolini, Too Much Is Crippling, 1936 “We then ask the Italian Jews: are you a religion or are you a nation? This question is not intended to give rise to anti-Semitic riots, but merely to bring to light a problem which I know exists, and which is useless to further ignore.” -Benito Mussolini, Religion or Nation? 1928 “We cannot remain deaf to the struggle for Fiume, we deeply feel the living nature of the ties that bind us not only with the Italians of Zara, Ragusa, Cattaro, but also with the Italians of Ticino, even with those Italians that do not wish to be Italian – with the Italians of Corsica, Italians living across the ocean, with that huge family that we wish to unite under the aegis of common racial pride.” -Benito Mussolini, First Fascist Congress, Milan March 23, 1919 “The genius of a race reborn, of Latin tradition, unchangingly active in our thousands of years old history, a return to the Roman and simultaneously Christian idea of state, a synthesis of the great past with a radiant future.” -The Fascist Decalogue, 1938",2023-11-25 00:02:10+00:00,https://t.me/MUSSOLINIAN2/10,,,2281,0,58,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now a lot has changed since then and of course we want to address today's times. It's the run-up to Christmas and the children's eyes are sparkling more and more every day. The working week is over and on the weekend you visit the family or a Christmas market. These are now available in almost every place and the scheme is the same everywhere. Now there are Christmas markets that have a cozy character; these are usually found in small towns or villages. there are a few vendors selling goodies and a few vendors selling home-made products. Colorful lights, some music and maybe a campfire. Small, tranquil Christmas markets without much stress for visitors. Then there is the contrast to these small Christmas markets. These now resemble a lot of hype. In addition to all the vendors' stalls, there are a lot of rides and in the evening it can be more like a party mile. This is where annual sales come in for some retailers. But all of this has nothing to do with visiting a Christmas market in peace and relaxation. For many of the visitors, this means throwing out money for even more and even more expensive gifts. Not only market traders appreciate this, but also the shops on the shopping streets. A total sensory overload hits you...everything is bright and brightly lit and music is booming everywhere. People push past each other on the hunt from bargain to bargain. Overall, there is no need to go into this further and the difference that we want to record becomes clear. Now we don't want to tell anyone where to go, but we do want to draw attention to it. The small Christmas markets in particular still offer a calming atmosphere and the traders there mostly offer regional products. We don't need to mention any further what advantages regional products have compared to the others.

Die Arbeitswoche ist geschafft und am Wochenende besucht man die Familie oder eben einen Weihnachtsmarkt. Diese gibt es nun beinahe in jeden Ort und das Schema ist überall dasselbe.

Es gibt ein paar Händler mit Leckereien und ein paar Händler, die selbst hergestellte Produkte verkaufen. Bunte Lichter, etwas Musik und vielleicht ein Lagerfeuer. Kleine beschauliche Weihnachtsmärkte ohne viel Stress für die Besucher. Dann gibt es den Gegensatz zu diesen kleinen Weihnachtsmärkten. Diese gleichen mittlerweile eher einen großen Rummel. Neben den ganzen Buden von den Händlern reihen sich jede Menge Fahrgeschäfte dazu und zum Abend kann es eher einer Partymeile gleichen. Hier wird der Jahresumsatz eingefahren für manche Händler. Doch das alles hat dann nichts mehr damit zu tun, in Ruhe und entspannt einen Weihnachtsmarkt zu besuchen.

In mehreren Mannschaften machte man sich in Wald, Wiese und am Strand auf und füllte in relativ kurzer Zeit -zig Säcke mit Müll. Trotz des teils verregneten Wetters gab es kein Verzagen unter den Kameraden, sich dieser Aufgabe zu stellen, sollte es doch als Selbstverständlichkeit gelten. Die Mengen, die auf uns zukamen, konnte man nach relativ kurzer Zeit jedoch schon nicht mehr in Worte fassen...

The Germanic descendants of Hyperborea knew the Irminsul and the world tree. The tree gives our atmosphere its properties, without its O2 our sky literally collapses. The mountain and the tree have a tapered shape. Their respective width corresponds to the speed of the flow of time. At different heights there are different worlds with faster or slower clocks. The Hyperborea have put their multidimensional knowledge into stories and told it to all peoples during their visits over the last 15,000 years. For some, the tree remained the example, for others the mountain - depending on what their habitat looked like. But the original form remained. *The names of our original homeland vary depending on the era and the respective region - that's why there are so many names for the same habitat",2024-11-20 16:50:59+00:00,https://t.me/GreenlineFrontDeutschland/120,,,472,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The trip started a few days earlier. In addition to exploring the city, there were some meetings with representatives of different nations and great conversations. November 11th is Independence Day in Poland. The evening before we attended the second conference, where various representatives of the nations spoke about the topic of migration. The views that were presented were shared by everyone present and we could already sense what was to come the following day. We were out and about early, carried by the energy that had been in the city since the early hours of the morning. Before we were supposed to go on the march, we met up with other friends again. We now went together to the starting point for the march. While the press wrote something about the march of radical people, we had a completely different impression. It is a day for Poland, for Europe. There were a lot of people there, from young to old and even whole families with children. We ourselves didn't notice anything about what the press was warning about. So we arrived at our starting point and started moving. It's just a great feeling and we'll be able to remember this experience forever. After the march ended, there were further meetings with various people. It's all a round thing and we recommend that everyone take a look at it for themselves, collect their own impressions and the press propaganda will quickly be refuted. We had a great few days. We would like to take this opportunity to thank our friends from Poland, Macedonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Denmark and also the USA. At this point we also greet the structure of Intermarium and hope that you hold on.

Die Reise begann ein paar Tage schon zuvor. Es gab neben dem erkunden der Stadt,einige Treffen mit Vertretern verschiedener Nationen und tolle Gespräche. Der 11.11 der Unabhängigkeitstag in Polen. Noch am Vorabend wohnten wir der zweiten Konferenz bei, wo verschiedene Vertreter der Nationen über das Thema Migration sprachen. Die Ansichten die dargestellt wurden,teilten alle Anwesende und schon jetzt spürte man was am folgenden Tag auf uns zukommen sollte. Schon früh waren wir unterwegs,getragen von der Energie die schon seit den frühen Morgenstunden in der Stadt lag. Bevor es zum Marsch hingehen sollten, trafen wir uns erneut mit weiteren Freunden. Gemeinsam ging es nun zum Ausgangspunkt für den Marsch. Während die Presselandschaft etwas vom Aufmarsch radikaler Menschen schrieb,hatten wir einen ganz anderen Eindruck. Es ist ein Tag für Polen, für Europa. Es waren viele Menschen dort unterwegs, von Jung bis Alt und selbst ganze Familie mit Kindern. Wir selbst haben somit nichts wahrgenommen von dem,wovor die Presse warnte. Wir kamen also an unserem Ausgangspunkt an und setzten uns in Bewegung. Es ist einfach ein tolles Gefühl und von diesem Erlebnis werden wir noch ewig für uns zerren können. Nach Beendigung des Marsches, gab es weitere Treffen mit verschiedenen Leuten. Es ist alles eine Runde Sache und wir empfehlen jeden sich das selbst einmal anzusehen,eigene Eindrücke dort zu sammeln und schon schnell ist die Presse Hetze wiederlegt. Wir hatten ein paar tolle Tage. Wir möchten uns auf diesem Wege noch einmal besonders bei unseren Freunden aus Polen, Mazedonien, Litauen, Lettland, Dänemark und auch der USA bedanken. Wir grüßen an dieser Stelle auch die Struktur von Intermarium und hoffen für euch das ihr durchhaltet.

msg_iteration.83.user.GreenlineFrontDeutschland.post.57,2020073583,GreenlineFrontDeutschland,57,,"Was bedeutet nachhaltig leben? Unsere Großeltern haben uns, unbewusst, gezeigt was heißt nachhaltig zu leben. Es fängt schon im Kleinen an. Wenn die Socke ein Loch hatte, wurde diese nicht weggeworfen, sondern gestopft. Dieses Beispiel zieht sich über alle täglichen Bereiche, wir müssen lernen zu reparieren, anstatt es wegzuwerfen. Man kann aus dem „braunen/angeschlagenen“ Obst zum Beispiel Marmelade oder Mus kochen, dafür kann man dann die leeren Gläser wiederverwenden. Hier werden dann 2 Fliegen mit einer Klappe geschlagen, das angeschlagene Obst und die Gläser werden sinnvoll genutzt. Gemüse kann man Einlegen/Einkochen, um es haltbar zu machen. Beim Kauf von Obst und Gemüse sollte man immer regional und saisonal kaufen, im besten Fall vom Erzeuger direkt, wenn das geografisch nicht möglich ist, dann auf die Kennzeichnung achten, von wo es kommt. Wer z.B. auf Erdbeeren im Winter nicht verzichten will, der kann diese im Sommer schon „einmachen“. Diese kleinen Dinge bringen schon eine ganze Menge und ersparen lange Flug oder Schiffswege. Das bringt uns auf das Thema „Bio“, denn nicht überall, wo Bio draufsteht, ist Bio drin. Nehmen wir die Karotten als Beispiel, man kann keine Bio-Karotten mit gutem Gewissen aus Ägypten kaufen da schon der Lieferweg alles andere als nachhaltig ist. Zumal die meisten Länder keine so hohen Anforderungen wie in Deutschland haben, was Pestizide betrifft. Ebenso ist beim kauf von Eiern auf verschiedene Punkte zu achten. Bodenhaltung oder Freilandhaltung klingen erst einmal gut, aber was heißt das genau? Auch bei diesen Haltungsformen handelt es sich um Massentierhaltung, die nicht annähernd artgerecht sind. Hier wäre die beste Lösung auch wieder frisch vom Bauern. Eine alternative wäre, Bio-Eier ohne Kückentötung. Was uns direkt zum Thema Fleisch/Fisch führt. Hier gibt es auch einiges zu beachten. Unsere Großeltern haben uns gelehrt das eine ausgewogene Ernährung wichtig ist das bedeutet nicht jeden Tag muss der Braten auf den Tisch. Sonntags gab es den Braten und Freitags Fisch. Wer aber nicht auf täglichen Fleisch Konsum verzichten möchte, der sollte genau hinschauen. Prinzipiell wäre die humanste Art für die Tiere, die Jagd hier wachsen die Tiere im natürlichen Lebensraum auf. Die Jagd bedeutet weniger Stress für das Tier. Wenn das nicht möglich ist, sollte man auch hier auf artgerechtes Tier-/Fischhaltung achten. Man sollte bedenken das „normale Tierhaltung“ meistens Tierquälerei ist da die Tiere auf engstem Platz gehalten und mit Medikamenten/Antibiotika gefüttert werden welches wir dann mitessen. Bei Fleisch unterscheiden wir in 4 Haltungsformen. 1. „Stallhaltung“, bedeutet den niedrigsten Standard und erfüllt „nur“ die gesetzliche Mindestanforderung. 2. „Stallhaltung Plus“, hier haben die Tiere minimal mehr Platz sich zu bewegen. 3. „Außenklima“, nochmal ein bisschen mehr Platz und außerdem müssen die Ställe mindestens an einer Seite offenstehen. 4. „Premium“, hier dürfen die Tiere entweder in Freilandhaltung leben oder sie dürfen durch einen ständigen Zugang selbst entscheiden. Fazit beim Thema Fleisch, Haltungsform 3 und 4 sind gerade noch so vertretbar, wobei man 1 und 2 ablehnen sollte. Das alles ist nichts neues dennoch vergessen wir es oft. Gesund und nachhaltig leben ist nicht billig, aber das sind wir unserer Natur, unserer Tierwelt und unseren Kindern schuldig. Deshalb ist es sinnvoller das Obst, Gemüse und das Fleisch aus heimischen Regionen zu beziehen.",2024-09-09 20:25:33+00:00,https://t.me/GreenlineFrontDeutschland/57,,,4802,0,34,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Als weltweit führender Möbelproduzent verarbeitet Ikea jedes Jahr 20 Millionen Kubikmeter Holz. Trotz des immensen Verbrauchs wirbt der Großkonzern mit Umweltbewusstsein. Zu Recht? Der Dokumentarfilm deckt die weltweiten Verbindungen zwischen dem Möbelmulti und einer unkontrollierten Holzproduktion auf. IKEA ist der weltweit führende Möbelproduzent. Um Produkte wie das Bücherregal „Billy“, das Regal „Kallax“ und den Beistelltisch „Lack“ auf der ganzen Welt verkaufen zu können, verarbeitet der Großkonzern jedes Jahr 20 Millionen Kubikmeter Holz – einen Baum alle zwei Sekunden. Trotz dieses immensen Verbrauchs wirbt der Konzern, der einen Jahresumsatz von über 44 Milliarden Euro erwirtschaftet, mit Umweltbewusstsein und Nachhaltigkeit. Ein grünes Image, das beim Verbraucher ankommt. Doch die Realität sieht anders aus. Das Filmteam verfolgte mehr als ein Jahr lang die Produktionskette von IKEA – von den Wäldern im hohen Norden Schwedens über die Küsten Neuseelands bis hin zu Plantagen in Brasilien und den Waldgebieten von Polen und Rumänien. In einer internationalen Recherche deckte das Team die Verbindungen zwischen dem Möbelmulti und einer intensiven und unkontrollierten Holzproduktion auf. Der Dokumentarfilm untersucht, wie IKEA trotz ständiger Wiederaufforstung zur Zerstörung der Biodiversität beiträgt und den illegalen Holzhandel befeuert. Zum Beispiel in Rumänien, wo der Konzern 50.000 Hektar Wald besitzt und unterduchschnittliche Produktionsbedingungen herrschen. Hier begehren Aktivistinnen und Aktivisten unter Lebensgefahr gegen die Holzmafia auf. „Wie IKEA den Planeten plündert“ gewährt Einblicke in ein globales Unternehmen, das mit seinem diskreten und expandierenden Holzbusiness Profit macht – als sei dieser Rohstoff, der im Kampf gegen den Klimawandel eine entscheidende Rolle spielt, unerschöpflich.

Sie sind mit dafür verantwortlich das unsere Blumen und Bäume im Frühjahr blühen. Sie bestäuben was das Zeug hält und kommen jeden Tag an ihre Grenzen. Wer selber Bienen im Garten hat, oder sie mal bewusst wo anders beobachtet hat, der weiß was die kleinen leisten. Lasst sie uns schützen. Wir brauchen sie. Jahr für Jahr. Wie wir Ihnen am besten helfen? Blumenwiesen die Bienen freundlich sind. Büsche und streucher auch mal wachsen lassen. Im Netz gibt es viele gute Anleitungen für Bienenhotels und was genau ihr im Frühjahr im Garten nutzen könnt damit euer Garten/Balkon Bienen freundlich ist. Wir werden euch aber noch zeigen wie wir unsere Hotels bauen und welches Saatgut wir nutzen. Helft also mit.

Ob auf dem Fichtelberg oder der Besichtigung der Stadt Karlsbad. Auf der Insel Usedom wurde eine kleine Runde gedreht und Müll gesammelt. Hier ging es in Korswand um den Wolgastsee, in der Nähe ist auch die deutsch/polnische Grenze. Wieder andere erkundeten in Greifswald das kleine Fischerdorf Wick am Ryck. Auch im Bergischen Land im schönen Nordrhein und Westfalen wurde gewandert. Durch Berg und Tal,viele schöne Ecken in den Wäldern erkundet und das Wissen aus und um die Region von alt nach jung weiter gegeben. Zwischen all dem fanden noch der Vater- und der Muttertag statt. Diese verbrachte im Kreise der Familien. Am 8 Mai machte man sich auf den Weg und gedachte der deutschen Opfer des letzten großen Krieges. So wurde das Kriegerdenkmal der Stadt Usedom aufgesucht, vom Müll befreit und etwas hergerichtet. In Stolpe auf Usedom wurden auch ein paar selbst gepflückte Blumen im Kreise der Familie an einem Ehrenmal niedergelegt.

In Mecklenburg Vorpommern ging es mit einer großen Futterspende und einen Gutschein für Tierbedarf zu einem Tierhof. Zuvor wurde sich informiert was gebraucht wird um dann entsprechend zu handeln. Die Mitarbeiter des Tierhofes waren sichtlich erfreut über den Besuch. Nach dem die Spenden abgegeben wurden, gab es für Klein und Groß noch einen Rundgang und ein paar interessante Gespräche. Es bleibt dabei, die meisten Tierhöfe machen alles ehrenamtlich. Ein Grund mehr diese zu unterstützen. Wir appellieren an alle!!! Tiere sind kein Spielzeug!!! In Baden-Württemberg hingehen machte man eine kleine Wanderung entlang des Ebnissee. Während man dort einige Stellen vom Unrat bereinigte, kam man auch hier mit anderen Spaziergänger ins Gespräch. Wir appellieren an alle!!! Müll gehört in dafür vorgesehene Behälter!!! In Niedersachsen hingehen werkelte man an Insektenhotels. Auch hier war man fleißig bei der Arbeit. Bei einem kleinen Spaziergang sammelte man Müll ein. Viele kleinere bauliche Projekte stehen hier noch an, ob für Insekten, Vögel und viele andere Tieren. Wir appellieren an alle!!! Die Zerstörung von Bauten für Tiere sind abstoßend!!! Dieses Wochenende war der Anfang. Die Greenline Front Deutschland wird noch öfter in Erscheinung treten. Wir wollen niemanden belehren oder etwas aufzwingen. Wir wollen ein Verständnis schaffen abseits der Links-Grünen Ideologie. Denn Naturschutz ist Heimatschutz!!!",2024-05-01 05:04:50+00:00,https://t.me/GreenlineFrontDeutschland/10,,,1178,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.66.user.rnintel.post.23074,1810182217,rnintel,23074,,"🇮🇱🇸🇾 Strategic Context of Israeli Strikes These attacks come amid a volatile period in Syria following the abrupt collapse of Assad’s regime. Analysts suggest the strikes are part of a broader Israeli strategy to neutralize military capabilities in Syria as the country transitions to new leadership. Ashraf Akka, an expert in international relations, explained that the airstrikes appear designed to “deny the nascent governing authorities in Syria any military leverage, including advanced weaponry or infrastructure that could shift regional power dynamics.” The port of Latakia is a critical hub for Syrian and allied forces. It has frequently been used to transport military equipment from Iran, a close ally of Assad’s regime, to Syria and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon. Its targeting underscores Israel’s ongoing concerns about Iran’s entrenchment in Syria and the potential transfer of advanced weaponry to hostile groups. The Ya’four and Damascus sites, central to Syria’s former military elite, hold symbolic and strategic importance. The strikes on these locations signal Israel’s intent to dismantle remnants of the Assad regime’s military infrastructure. Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria over the years, targeting Iranian and Hezbollah forces. These actions are part of what Israel refers to as its “campaign between wars” strategy, aimed at weakening its adversaries without provoking a full-scale conflict. The recent strikes come at a pivotal moment for Syria as the country grapples with political instability and security vacuums. Israel has not officially commented on the latest operations, in line with its policy of ambiguity regarding military actions in Syria. The escalation highlights the fragility of the post-Assad landscape in Syria. Human rights advocates and political analysts have called for international oversight to prevent further destabilization and ensure that power vacuums do not lead to unchecked violence.

The ACLU and the Biden Administration are arguing the ban violates the 14th Amendment. The ACLU lawyer, a trans named Chase Strangio is the first trans person to ever argue in front of the Supreme Court. In 2020 the last time a trans rights case was before the Court, they ruled 6-3 in favor of the ACLU agreeing that Civil Rights protections in hiring practices applied to transgenders. So far this morning the Conservative Justices are more reserved in their questioning of Strangio while the Liberal Justices Sotomayor, Jackson, and Kagan are bouncing off each other in heavily attacking Mathew Rice, the lawyer arguing in favor of Tennessee's law.

msg_iteration.2058.user.rnintel.post.21047,1810182217,rnintel,21047,,"🇱🇧🇮🇱 - WHY THE CEASEFIRE IS A DEFEAT FOR HEZBOLLAH / AXIS OF RESISTANCE: One cannot begin to unravel the timeline of the Third Lebanon War without going back further than October 8th, when Hezbollah began attacking northern Israel in support of Hamas. This began years ago, when Mossad implanted explosive devices inside pagers and walkie-talkies for Hezbollah operatives. What has been clear since October 7th is that Israel (more specifically, Netanyahu and his far-right coalition) knew that October 7th was actively being planned years in advance. They knew Hamas was going to attempt a large-scale incursion into Israel in an attempt to inflict as much damage as possible and, more importantly, court sympathy and intervention from the rest of the Middle East. Supporters / sympathizers of the Axis of Resistance (what we like to call ""resistards"") like to frame the entirety of the Israel issue as one of Zionism, rather than the instinctual nature of the Jews to subvert and deceive their enemy until total victory is obtained. Anti-Zionism does not adequately explain the behaviors of Israel, but true recognition of the Jewish problem explains the behavior of Israel as well as the behavior of Jews. As Israel knew Hamas was planning October 7th, the pager explosions and the evidence that has emerged surrounding that event prove that Israel knew Hezbollah would get involved on Hamas' behalf. There is no other explanation for this intricate level of planning and execution other than preknowledge. Israel - more specifically, the Mossad - is the kingpin of preknowledge, and it doesn't just apply to Israel's proximate wars in the Middle East. An organization as dangerous and threatening as Hezbollah, in the eyes of Israel, is not to be left unscrutinised. It's plausible, if not definite, that Hezbollah has been, for many years, infiltrated through-and-through by Israeli spies, who may not tamper with the activities of Hezbollah, but feed knowledge to Tel Aviv on circumstantial and topical threats to Israeli security. If Israel knew Hamas was going to attack Israel on October 7th, which they did, then Israel most certainly knew Hezbollah would get involved as well. There is no debate. The only thing up for debate is how much worse it will get for the Axis of Resistance. Netanyahu made it clear in his speech today that Iran is the next target. The incoming Trump administration will give Netanyahu whatever he wants with regards to bringing Iran to its knees. The ceasefire being put into place today ends the Lebanon front for good. It's highly unlikely that Hezbollah will start shooting again. It's leadership has been decapitated, and while it's military strength has been tested, it hasn't been destroyed. In short- Hezbollah is still functional as an organization, and it hasn't lost its ability to threaten Israel, but the ceasefire being put in place makes Hezbollah a non-threat, at least for the time being. Israel has achieved its objective- they haven't destroyed Hezbollah, but pacification via a ceasefire arrangement is a victory for Israel nonetheless. Any statements to the contrary from ""resistards"" is a coping mechanism. It's hard to tell what else Israel has planned in terms of detailed strategy, but Iran is next on the chopping block. Trump will give Netanyahu whatever resources he needs to confront Iran. Iran had its chance to prevent this from happening, but it seems that Iran's existence will be put to the test in the coming months.",2024-11-26 19:57:38+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/21047,,,5399,0,97,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The state of the race, according to pollsters, are as follows: Final New York Times polls show a Harris win. 🔵 Final Emerson College polls show a Trump win. 🔴 Final YouGov polls show a Harris win. 🔵 Final Morning Consult polls show a Trump win. 🔴 Nate Silvers' model has reverted to 51/49 in favor of Trump. 🔴 While Trump maintains a 0.1% lead in the RCP average. 🔴 And the betting markets still expect a Trump win. 🔴 The New York Times commented yesterday that the response bias from Democrats, especially White Democrats, is as bad as 2016 and 2020, potentially resulting in another poll error in favor of Republicans. The internal polling for the campaigns is a bit better for Trump as his campaign internals show him down only by 2 in Virginia and up with all swing states, despite a slight tie in Michigan and some cause for concern regarding North Carolina. Democrat internal polls agree with the public polling that Harris will win the Midwest, and therefore the election. Their final days of campaigning reflect this, as Harris is doing all 4 of her final rallies in Pennsylvania, while Trump is going to North Carolina, followed by 2 stops in Pennsylvania, and finishing off the race in Grand Rapids Michigan, the site of his grand finale in 2016. The early vote data in Florida, Nevada, and Pennsylvania look to be indicating a very strong Republican performance, although the gender gap in turnout is about a point or 2 more female than 2020 depending on the state.

msg_iteration.4846.user.rnintel.post.18219,1810182217,rnintel,18219,,"🇸🇾 - The situation in the north of Syria this morning: The Suqour al-Sham Brigades have entered the Turkish military stronghold of Kafr Jennah, fighting still ongoing. East of Azaz, the Suqour al-Sham Brigades have captured Joint Forces stronghold of Akhtarin. Media affiliated with the Sultan Murad Division (of the Joint Forces) claim they have captured Hawar Kilis, however there is no evidence of this yet. Their forces did however storm Suqour al-Sham Brigades headquarters in the north of the city last night. Although both sides were initially armed by Turkey, it seems Turkey has sided with the Sultan Murad Division and the rest of the Joint Forces. Large Turkish military convoys were seen moving towards Kafr Jennah last night as well as Turkish UAV strikes on Suqour al-Sham positions. The Suqour al-Sham Brigades are being supported by the US-backed Levant Forces. Essentially, the fighting has resulted in the end of the Syrian National Army (SNA), causing it to split - both sides were major subgroups of the SNA. Most of the smaller SNA units have remained neutral and have been calling for ceasefires, although some have sided with the Sultan Murad Division. Currently, the Turkish-backed Joint Forces are on the backfoot, with the US-backed Levant Forces gaining ground rapidly. There has been no infighting around Idlib, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has remained largely neutral but has voiced support for the Suqour al-Sham Brigades. And the Turkistan Islamic Party, Ansar al-Tawhid and the Uyghurs mercenaries have also remained largely neutral. Suqour al-Sham affiliated media claims Turkey has begun recalling Sultan Murad mercenaries (mostly ethnic Azerbaijanis and Uyghurs) from Libya back to Syria as reinforcements. However, there is no evidence of this yet. Russia has taken the opportunity to bombard both sides while they fight each other, with constant airstrikes throughout the night and into the morning.",2024-10-17 10:51:17+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/18219,,,15206,0,114,0,,,,,,,1,18215.0,https://t.me/rnintel/18215,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.6119.user.rnintel.post.16920,1810182217,rnintel,16920,,"Israel has had surprising success with its airstrikes, assassinations, and cyberattacks against Hezbollah— but if the War Cabinet is seriously considering a ground operation in south Lebanon that could be a different story. Israel certainly wants the world to think that this is imminent, whether or not they intend to follow through. Maybe it’s leverage, maybe it’s bait. If Israel is planning an invasion it will be a completely different story than the ongoing conflict. Israel can’t rely on airpower and tech “wizardry” alone, they’ll have to overcome the tactical problems that cost them the war in 2006.

But, at this point, it will require near pin-point precise calculations and decision making on behalf of Hezbollah and Iran in order to avoid an all-out war.

It would be a bloody and brutal war, for both sides, but Hezbollah would likely come out on top in a painful but nonetheless pyrrhic victory.

msg_iteration.7122.user.rnintel.post.15898,1810182217,rnintel,15898,,"🇱🇧🇮🇱 - Some commentary on the increasing tensions between Hezbollah and Israel: It's very obvious that Israel is vigorously working to coax Hezbollah into a massive retaliation in order to acquire a justification to launch a full-scale war against Lebanon. Of course, this is not in Hezbollah's interest. Hezbollah has stated - since October 8th - that its entire objective is to thwart the ambitions of Israel and to support Hamas in Gaza. If Hezbollah were to launch a massive retaliation, they would be serving Israel exactly what they want on a silver platter, and it would allow Israel to invade Lebanon and turn Lebanon into the next Gaza. At the same time, however, Hezbollah has proven itself for the last 40 years to be the single greatest threat to Israel, besides Iran, as Iran does not share any land border or proximity to Israel. The only way that Hezbollah has maintained this image is by displaying its power and deterrence through occasional spikes in attacks, which Hezbollah has not fully committed to showing off since Israel has ""moved the front"" to the north. Hezbollah did not have to enter the conflict between Hamas and Israel on October 8th. However, they did, when they really did not have to. It was a very bold but risky move to make, and this move required immense calculus on behalf of Hezbollah's senior leadership in anticipating the worst case scenario, which has arrived. In retrospect, the ruling Likud regime in Israel more than likely wanted and expected Hezbollah to enter the conflict in some way, as this would justify wiping out all of Israel's closest threats, and ultimately finishing off the entire cycle by coaxing the United States into war with Iran, the one country Israel has no chance of defeating on its own. To summarize, Hezbollah is stuck. If they retaliate too strongly for the recent actions of Israel, they risk the entirety of Lebanon being decimated in the same way that Gaza was. If they don't retaliate at all, which is ostensibly what they have been doing for the last few weeks, then they risk being disregarded as a legitimate threat to Israel, they lose all of their deterrence against Israel, and are ultimately destroyed. In short- they're damned if they do, damned if they don't. Hezbollah hasn't miscalculated their actions, it would seem, but they are stuck in an impossible balance of maintaining their security deterrence and strength while also preventing all-out war in Lebanon. Hezbollah is part of the Lebanese political establishment, and so they have accountability to the Lebanese public and political system. It will be very difficult for Hezbollah to maintain any kind of prominence in Lebanon if they are disarmed - whether forcibly by Israel or forcibly by the public - and they will be destroyed in the end. This explains why Hezbollah has done next to nothing in response to the grotesque pager terrorist attacks, followed by the unprecedented airstrikes and decapitation strikes against Hezbollah military leadership. At once, they must retaliate to show their strength, but they also must prevent all-out war in some way shape or form. The only two factors that could break this position that Hezbollah finds itself in are the United States and Iran. If the United States makes it clear they will not support any Israeli incursions into Lebanon, Hezbollah has a lot more wiggle room. However, this is unlikely. If Iran steps in and declares guarantees for Hezbollah and promises to intervene if Israel invades, Israel itself may have to recalculate and that would, in due time, give Hezbollah the room they need to strike back. As we previously wrote, the inaction by the Axis of Resistance has resulted in this situation. Israel definitely fears Hezbollah and Iran, they have made that very clear. However, they also feel free to push around the Axis of Resistance with no consequences, as they have not been attacked properly for their incredibly destabilizing actions.",2024-09-21 19:45:02+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/15898,,,4311,0,65,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So why is nobody talking about the obvious conclusion? Which is that the supposedly delusional, irrational hopes of Netanyahu to successfully confront Iran and Hezbollah in all likelihood rest on a blank check from the United States guaranteed by a Trump White House.

Hezbollah has done next to nothing to scale this back, deal with it preemptively, or establish reliable deterrence with Israel at all. In short- Hezbollah has ignored the realities of Israel's ambitions, which is to destroy all of their neighboring threats, in one war. Hezbollah has had ample time to prepare defenses for something like today. They should have, and likely did know that Israel was planning on moving the frontline to the north. They clearly ignored all possible threats and chose to pretend they were king of the hill. Today, Israel carried out a grotesque and inhumane violation of not just Lebanon's sovereignty, but the dignity of humankind. Blowing up pagers and risking tens of thousands of civilians is something Israel is more than familiar with doing, but Hezbollah dug its head in the sand and pretended like everything was okay. Today's attacks in Lebanon have crippled Hezbollah- not entirely, but definitely for a time. Hundreds, if not thousands of fighters are missing fingers, limbs, and eyesight. Those injured today will likely never go back to combat. Hospitals are now packed full of injured innocents, and Hezbollah will never attack Israel when their communications are crippled and their hospitals filled. Hezbollah brought this on themselves. Resisting Israel with ""strong words of condemnation"" and miniscule, pussyfooted attacks is not enough to keep Israel in check. In fact, it energized Israel and made them push the envelope even further. Perhaps the Axis of Resistance wakes up to the reality of their ineptitude, inaction, and weakness- but they likely won't.

Recruiting mercenaries and foreign fighters for Ukraine, shilling openly for NATO, posting his phone number on social media for people to ""contact him"" to fight in Ukraine, attempting to recruit NATO-trained Afghan fighters to deploy to Ukraine, and his various visits to Ukraine and DC on behalf of ""recruiting"" for Ukraine- all of this is indicative of someone who either works for the State Department or some other covert federal project to support Ukraine through means other than direct military aid. The only real question is this- why did he target Trump? There seems to be some evidence that this was personal and premeditated, given his somewhat obvious social media objections to Trump dating back to 2020. However, was the targeting of Trump something he was ordered to do by his handlers - who apparently are either State Department or some kind of military complex - or was this his own little venture? Given this attempted assassin actually survived and can be cross-examined, unlike the last shooter, we may find some answers, but given the nature of this man's background and the heavy involvement of the FBI, it's not likely we'll be given a lot of truth, in fact this entire case may end up being memory-holed as an ""incident"" rather than an attempt on Trump's life.",2024-09-16 02:11:48+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/14855,,,5530,0,65,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past few days Ukrainian forces in the north had also recaptured Snagost and Vishnevka. The pincer attack on Koronevo continues, with Ukraine's eastern flank capturing Olgovka, Zhuravli and Kalinov. Vetreno is now grey-zone as both sides claim control. In the center the lines have almost stabilized. The Kositsa-Pravda-Kubatkin axis has been confirmed to be under Ukrainian control. Yesterday Russia's Arbat unit recaptured Nachayev. Some of the fiercest battles took place along the Martynovka-Mikhailovka sector which Ukrainian forces won but took heavy losses, capturing both towns. Russian sources claim Ukraine has already begun attacking Pushkarnoe. In the south, the situation continues to deteriorate for the Ukrainian troops. A week ago Ukrainian forces were on the outskirts of Giri, however since then they have lost Kamyshnoe, Krupets and Spalnoe, with Borki now being contested by both sides. In the far-west, Ukrainian attempts to take Tetkino have all failed. Ukrainian forces have destroyed two bridges over the Seym river, with just the Zvannoe bridge remaining. While Russia quickly builds pontoon crossings, Ukraine is destroying them just as fast. The objective seems to be to trap over 3,000 Russian troops south of the river. Ukrainian forces control 850 sqkm in the Kursk region, excluding grey-zones and DRG operations - far shorter than Oleksandr Syrskyi's claim of 1,263 sqkm.",2024-08-22 09:37:24+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/13764,,,5765,0,17,0,,,,,,,1,13638.0,https://t.me/rnintel/13638,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
