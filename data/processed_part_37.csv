msg_iteration.1811.user.arcaneaccents.post.140,1954060366,arcaneaccents,140,,"Yesterday, on Midsummer, archeologists announced a monumental find in the Netherlands. A large sacred site with burial mounds and grave fields arranged as a solar calendar, for which it's been called the Dutch Stonehenge. They have found over a million items, which show the site was in use for at least 800 years starting from the early Bronze Age, but probably for much longer afterwards. Because of the way this lovely country works, the site will NOT be preserved. There is an industrial development planned, and the municipality deems it isn't worth protecting since a large scale touristic attraction (like at Stonehenge) can't be realized. This is of course outrageous, and together with Zonnevlam and Swesaz we are organizing action to try and save this sacred site. Please sign the petition so we can put pressure on the municipality! The website is in Dutch but it's very easy, enter your name/initials and email address, then don't forget to confirm your signature through the email they send you! Please share this far and wide!

This was my first foray into detailed line work, gold leafing, and watercolor after years of working solely in acrylics. I started out using the watercolors the way I used acrylics and didn't begin getting the hang of them until about midway through. I am looking forward to continuing with this medium. The sun, parts of the oak leaves, and some hair is gold leafed. I botched the sun due to impatience, forcing me to layer multiple sheets of leafing to cover mistakes. It's a bit bumpy as a result; I should have practiced first. It isn't bad if viewed uncritically. This was definitely art nouveau inspired although I did get more naturalistic rather than stylistic with some of the flora and fauna. I actually like the contrast between the more stylized/more realistic elements. I'd estimate I put around 20-30 hours into this; I enjoyed every single moment.

Founded in Munich by Georg Hirth who edited it until his death in 1916, the weekly was originally intended to showcase German Arts and Crafts, but became famous for showcasing the German version of Art Nouveau instead. It was also famed for its ""shockingly brilliant covers and radical editorial tone"" and for its avant-garde influence on German arts and culture for decades, ultimately launching the eponymous Jugendstil movement in Munich, Weimar and Germany's Darmstadt Artists' Colony.

Unlike the Dormition, this is a sad holiday, and perhaps that is why there are not so many churches in the Orthodox world dedicated to it, most of them belonging to the Russian Church. The deanery church in the Zaraisk Kremlin belongs to their number. Despite its neoclassical appearance, it was built in the early 20th century, during the brief second wave of popularity of this style.

msg_iteration.2675.user.tradpics.post.3419,1240292818,tradpics,3419,,"Saint Michael the Archangel monastery, Lesbos, Greece. The main relic of the church is the wonderworking sculpture of the Archangel Michael. The story of the appearance of the image is quite eerie: in the Middle Ages the monastery was attacked by Saracen pirates who killed many of its inhabitants. However, when they were about to kill young monk Gabriel, the Archangel Michael appeared before them and drove them away. Gabriel made a sculpture of Michael out of clay on which the blood of the murdered monks had been spilt. That is why the sculpture is a bust - there was not enough clay for the body. Some of the buildings in the monastery date back to the Middle Ages, but the catholicon was built in the 19th century. The monastery has long been gifted with weapons, and in modern times the Greek army has donated an entire fighter jet, which is now displayed at the entrance to the monastery.",2022-02-11 15:39:57+00:00,https://t.me/tradpics/3419,,,2555,0,6,1,PeerChannel,1167315864.0,orthoarch,2022-02-11 15:01:54,2022-02-11,https://t.me/orthoarch/3587,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is often counted among the German rivals of Versailles. While Sanssouci is in the more intimate Rococo style and is far smaller than its French Baroque counterpart, it too is notable for the numerous temples and follies in the park. The palace was designed/built by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff between 1745 and 1747 to fulfill King Frederick's need for a private residence where he could relax away from the pomp and ceremony of the Berlin court. The palace's name emphasises this; it is a French phrase (sans souci), which translates as ""without concerns"", meaning ""without worries"" or ""carefree"", symbolising that the palace was a place for relaxation rather than a seat of power.",2020-04-08 17:16:53+00:00,https://t.me/tradpics/1191,,,334,0,2,1,PeerChannel,1388623934.0,,2020-04-08 17:14:40,2020-04-08,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.187.user.Aryanpaganism.post.7686,1685658993,Aryanpaganism,7686,,"What is Perennialism? According to perennialism.org, ""The perennial philosophy states that at the heart of each authentic tradition lies One Universal, Timeless Truth that transcends all time and space. This Truth is beyond being. This Truth is the source of Scared Revelation. This Truth is God."" Often utilized in new age movements, modern perennialism originates from the theosophical society's Helena Blavatsky. The goal of theosophy is, ""To form a nucleus of the universal brotherhood of humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste, or colour; to encourage the study of comparative religion, philosophy, and science; and to investigate unexplained laws of Nature and the powers latent in human beings."" Essentially, they claim that in the far distant past all humanity had one religion. And that mystery religion could be rediscovered through comparative mythology & combining faiths into a new one universal religion, which they claim is ancient. Evola and Guénon use this & dubb it ""traditionalism™""",2024-10-03 05:29:17+00:00,https://t.me/Aryanpaganism/7686,,,1418,45,11,1,PeerChannel,1837319864.0,Pagan_Revivalism,2024-10-02 22:49:35,2024-10-02,https://t.me/Pagan_Revivalism/5984,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msg_iteration.188.user.Aryanpaganism.post.7685,1685658993,Aryanpaganism,7685,,"What is Syncretism? Oxford dictionary defines it as, ""the amalgamation or attempted amalgamation of different religions, cultures, or schools of thought."" Amalgamation is defined, ""the action, process, or result of combining or uniting."" Syncretism in practice would be combining the Germanic Wotan (head of the Aesir, creator of Midgard) with the Hindu Shiva (the destroyer of the world, who's not the head of the pantheon). Why would somebody combine them? Because they have a slight connection with death, they both carry pointy sticks (Wotan with a spear and Shiva with a trident) And some people claim they are ""cognate"", EVERYTHING else doesn't match. The earliest known case of syncretism documented comes from plato, who wrote in his timaeus that, ""Nephthys is secretly Athena."" Why? Because both are slightly connected with death. Never mind that they have completely different legends, completely different genealogies. None of that matters only vague similarities matter when combining old Gods into new Gods.",2024-10-03 04:44:54+00:00,https://t.me/Aryanpaganism/7685,,,1475,83,16,1,PeerChannel,1837319864.0,Pagan_Revivalism,2024-10-02 22:18:18,2024-10-02,https://t.me/Pagan_Revivalism/5983,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.329.user.Aryanpaganism.post.7523,1685658993,Aryanpaganism,7523,,"The phrase ""we don't need a Bible in heathenry"" is often used by those who are either uneducated with traditional practices or by individuals influenced by New Age thinking. This sentiment typically stems from a rejection of orthodoxy and orthopraxy, driven by an unwillingness to acknowledge that their beliefs might be modern interpretations or inventions. This resistance is a form of cognitive dissonance—a psychological conflict that arises when one's behavior or beliefs contradict their values. In every polytheistic culture that developed literacy, sacred texts emerged to record their beliefs and practices. These texts documented everything from creation myths and divine interactions to prophecies of the world’s end. This is why the lore is invaluable; it represents the mythic histories of our ancestors and provides the clearest insight into their worldview, customs, and historical context. While the term ""Bible"" is specific to Christianity, other cultures have their own sacred texts. The Shinto tradition has the Kojiki and Nihon-gi, the Greeks have the Odyssey and Hesiod's Theogony, the Romans have the Aeneid and Ovid's Fasti, the Hindus have the Vedas, and the Egyptians have the Book of the Dead. For us, as Germanic heathens, our sacred texts include the Poetic Edda and skaldic poetry from the heathen era. Additionally, we have sagas, historical accounts, and secondary sources like Snorri's Prose Edda, which together form what we refer to as the lore—a comprehensive body of knowledge about our ancestors' customs and practices. All ancient cultures preserved sacred knowledge, whether through written texts or oral traditions. Understanding this lore is essential for gaining a deeper appreciation of our heritage and culture. - Kyle Davis",2024-09-02 21:02:58+00:00,https://t.me/Aryanpaganism/7523,,,1742,0,8,1,PeerChannel,1168822733.0,TheNorroenaSociety,2024-09-01 23:02:17,2024-09-01,https://t.me/TheNorroenaSociety/1207,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.348.user.Aryanpaganism.post.7504,1685658993,Aryanpaganism,7504,,"Teleology is not something that folkish pagans really think about one way or another, but there are good reasons to reject it. Folkishness is an immanentist worldview. It sees the specific, the embodied, and the historical as the final source of good and truth. Folkishness is a this-worldly outlook. Teleology doesn't seem to be opposed to any of this at first glance. Teleology is the idea that morality is about ends, and ends are inherent in nature. It's just baked into the idea of a watch (it's the end or telos of a watch) that it be portable, tell the time, etc. and you can measure a thing's goodness by whether it furthers its end, or telos. Teleology says that everything in reality has a telos. Again, nothing anti-folkish on the surface. The problem is that an end implies a goal, a goal implies an intention, and intention implies a mind. If everything in reality has an end, this means that it embodies an intention, and thus a mind. So as soon as we admit that everything in reality has a telos, we admit that there exists a transcendent mind that imparts its telos. The burden of teleology is that to believe in teleology is to be an idealist. Idealism implies a transcendent mind—all reality is basically a simulation, thought within the mind of a transcendent creator god. This is all anti-folkish through and through. So if you're a folkish pagan, think twice about teleology. You don't need it to account for any feature of the world, and to believe it is to open the door for some very bad things. @folkishworldview",2024-08-25 08:49:41+00:00,https://t.me/Aryanpaganism/7504,,,2244,0,10,1,PeerChannel,2047847238.0,folkishworldview,2024-08-25 08:18:01,2024-08-25,https://t.me/folkishworldview/307,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is also quite interesting that each of these cults would point to a singular god as the ""one true god™."" That the traditional Gods and Goddesses may exist, but are aspects, emanations or symbollic principles of this one singularity that can't be described but is confidently asserted as the true-truth™. This ploy was tried and failed first by the heretic Pharoah Akhenaten, but tried again successfully through the revisionist priest Zarathustra. From Persia, it spread East (uppanishad hinduism & later buddhism) & West (Pythagoras/Plato).

Sacrifices could of course be performed anywhere when needed, for example on a journey, but the established places of worship were found where people lived. In the parallels to the Gunnsteinar mentioned by Hermann Pálsson from Kristni saga and Þorvalds þáttr víðfǫrla (which are variants of the same story) and from the young saga of Icelanders, Harðar saga, the stones are located close to the farmhouses. In the latter saga, the stone is even located inside a building (in a blóthús). The spirit living in the stone in Kristni saga and in Þorvalds þáttr víðfǫrla is a ármaðr, a spirit of the garðvǫrðr type.

But most of their rhetoric relies on people not knowing the basic tenets of the religion. It's just as much a vector for quasi-liberal degeneracy as any other Christianity. For example, Eastern Orthodox is inherently opposed to ethnic identity in its churches. It hates anything that looks like nationalism and wants to subordinate ethnos to religion. In fact, in the 19th century, the Ecumenical Patriarchate declared this kind of religious nationalism a heresy called phyletism (from Greek ""phyle"" meaning tribe). The worry is that this sort of religious nationalism might ""exploit the Church in order to discriminate against those of other races and nations solely for the benefit of the race and the nation.""

Another one was Dionysus, who was said by the Greeks to be the son of Zeus-the “father of the gods.” In other words, Dionysus was considered the “son of god,” or the “son of the father.” His mother was a mortal named Semele, who was supernaturally impregnated by Zeus. Dionysus, like Christ, was a traveling teacher and he was alleged to be the god of wine. This too is similar to Christ, who put a heavy emphasis on wine, both in the ceremonial “Lord’s Supper” and the “miracle” of turning water into wine at the Cana wedding feast.

He also said that his yoke was easy and his burden light. Buddha said: “He who wishes to follow me must know himself and bear my yoke.” - Christ said to love our fellow man and to do good to those who persecute us.

After the birth of Buddha, a hermit sage, who had heard the celebrations of angels, was told by them that the infant would sit on the throne of enlightenment.

Vedism on the other hand, is a true folkish religion. The oldest passages of the Rigveda say nothing about reincarnation. And when reincarnation does come in to a real folkish religion like Vedism, it is confined to rebirth in a lineage, within families: Release him to his fathers and again down from them, who, poured into you, travels according to his will. Let him who wears life come to his offspring. Let him join his body, Jātavedas!’ – RV 10.16.5 Vedism emphatically does not involve rebirth as a mouse, a flea, or a horsefly. Buddhism is a late development of Vedanta and the Upanishads, which are themselves late developments of the original Aryan religion. They are said to be secret teachings, probably because they were heretical and contrary to orthodox Vedic interpretation during the actual Vedic period. Folkish Aryan religion sees reincarnation as confined within lineages, as Celtic and Germanic paganism does. Buddhism is not and cannot be folkish. It universalizes the moral circle, extending it to all life and beyond even this lifetime.

Dating back to the Viking Age or early medieval period (9th to 12th centuries), the tapestry provides a rare and fascinating glimpse into the heathen traditions and the newly adopted Christian customs and imagery. The Överhogdal Tapestry is renowned for its intricate designs and expert craftsmanship. Created using wool and plant dyes, the tapestry showcases the incredible skill of its weavers. The detailed depictions include trees, animals, human figures, and scenes that are thought to represent mythological events and everyday life in ancient Scandinavia. The tapestry's images are a vibrant display of Norse mythology and culture: -Mythical Trees: Representations of the Yggdrasil -the World Tree. A representation of the cosmology. - Animals and Beasts: Iconic creatures from Norse myths -Human Figures: Scenes that might illustrate historical events or legendary sagas, reflecting the values and beliefs of the time. For those who follow traditional heathenry, the Överhogdal Tapestry is more than just an artifact; it is a sacred connection to our ancestors and their ways. The meticulous craftsmanship and the themes woven into the fabric reflect the worldview of our ancestors. By studying and preserving these tapestries, we honor the memory and skills of the ancient artisans who created them. Their work continues to inspire us to keep the old ways alive and to celebrate our rich heritage. Today, the Överhogdal Tapestry is carefully preserved and displayed, allowing us to appreciate the artistry and spiritual depth of our ancestors. It serves as a powerful reminder of the enduring legacy of heathen traditions and an important glimpse into the past. #thetraditionalheathens #Heathenry #ÖverhogdalTapestry #NorseMythology #CulturalHeritage #TraditionalCraftsmanship",2024-06-09 06:40:20+00:00,https://t.me/Aryanpaganism/7316,,,2034,0,9,1,PeerChannel,2140806840.0,thetraditionalheathens,2024-06-04 02:59:36,2024-06-04,https://t.me/thetraditionalheathens/69,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much of his story will be found in Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, Arwald is the last known pagan king in England, and his story is a poignant reminder of the ancient beliefs that once flourished across the land. King Arwald ruled the Isle of Wight during the 7th century, a time when the spread of Christianity was rapidly changing the religious landscape of Britain. Despite the growing influence of Christian missionaries, Arwald remained steadfast in his adherence to the old ways, embodying the enduring spirit of Germanic paganism. Arwald's resistance to conversion was not merely a personal choice but a defense of his people's cultural heritage. His reign symbolized a last stand for the pagan traditions that had been practiced for centuries. Unfortunately, this defiance led to conflict. In 686 AD, Arwald faced the forces of King Caedwalla of Wessex, a newly converted Christian king with ambitions to expand his territory. After a fierce battle, Arwald was killed, and his kingdom fell into the hands of Caedwalla. In a tragic turn, Arwald's brothers, who were captured and baptized under duress, were also executed shortly after. This marked the end of the last pagan kingdom in England, but Arwald's legacy lived on. Arwald's story is more than a historical footnote; it is a testament to the resilience of ancient traditions in the face of overwhelming change. As we honor his memory, we celebrate the rich cultural and spiritual heritage of our ancestors. #TheTraditionalHeathens #PaganHistory #KingArwald #NorseMythology #CulturalHeritage #GermanicPaganism",2024-06-07 22:25:37+00:00,https://t.me/Aryanpaganism/7312,,,1959,7,22,1,PeerChannel,2140806840.0,thetraditionalheathens,2024-06-07 19:18:17,2024-06-07,https://t.me/thetraditionalheathens/72,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Weregild was essentially a form of compensation paid by a person who committed a crime, such as murder, to the family of the victim. This practice was not just about reparation but was deeply rooted in the cultural and social norms of Germanic tribes. Weregild helped prevent ongoing feuds and vendettas by ensuring that justice could be achieved financially rather than through further bloodshed. The amount paid varied depending on the status of the victim, reflecting the hierarchical nature of society at the time. Leaders, warriors, and commoners each had a specific weregild value, emphasizing the societal importance of each individual’s role. This system shows how interconnected justice, economics, and social status were in these communities. Weregild is a testament to the complex legal systems of the early Germanic peoples and offers us a glimpse into their efforts to establish social harmony in a time when the rule of law was considered a pillar of society. Weregild was replaced with capital punishment around the 9th century in medieval England due to Christianity.",2024-04-28 09:32:39+00:00,https://t.me/Aryanpaganism/7157,,,2197,1,10,1,PeerChannel,2140806840.0,thetraditionalheathens,2024-04-17 18:04:12,2024-04-17,https://t.me/thetraditionalheathens/43,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.682.user.Aryanpaganism.post.7155,1685658993,Aryanpaganism,7155,,"Monotheism and universalism are manifestations of what we now call liberalism. Even in ancient times. Folkish thinkers criticize Plato for this, with his singular conception of the good and totally abstract god. But Plato was not the first. 1000 years before him there was Akhenaten. Akhenaten was an Egyptian pharaoh who consolidated the Egyptian pantheon into a ""One"" called ""Aten"" or the sun. His god was abstract and impersonal. His eye was toward the beyond, with his transcendent god having very little to say about traditional duty. The common folk were forgotten. He retreated to the desert to build his city, an ""ivory tower"" with little care for folk culture. He was priestly and otherworldly, neglecting martial virtues (logos > thumos) and letting the military decay. Women were empowered and his chief wife Nefertiti gained unprecedented authority, almost as a co-regent. He introduced a new art style that promoted androgyny, novelty, ugliness, and deemed the old style unenlightening. He had an incestuous relationship with his own daughter by Nefertiti. His worship was as close to science as the ancient world would ever see. So close that it was essentially atheism. From Flinders Petrie: If this were a new religion, invented to satisfy our modern scientific conceptions, we could not find a flaw in the correctness of this view of the energy of the solar system. How much Akhenaten understood, we cannot say, but he certainly bounded forward in his views and symbolism to a position which we cannot logically improve upon at the present day. Not a rag of superstition or of falsity can be found clinging to this new worship evolved out of the old Aton of Heliopolis, the sole Lord of the universe. Monism, monotheism, and universalism manifest themselves the same way everywhere in history. They are three sides of the same coin, which is secularism. They are anti-folkish. They are only ever found in a dying civilization. Egypt managed to reverse all of them though, and lasted another 1000 years. @folkishworldview",2024-04-27 23:00:12+00:00,https://t.me/Aryanpaganism/7155,,,1581,0,26,1,PeerChannel,2047847238.0,folkishworldview,2024-04-27 16:22:01,2024-04-27,https://t.me/folkishworldview/234,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They see divine as something supernatural i.e. above and outside real, natural world. Gods are seen as omnipotent and omnipresent, even though all myth show that Gods are potent, but not omni. There’s an attempt by those occult-minded to separate divine and nature. They remove Gods from daily surrounding, essentially from reality. Their great deeds are shoved into so-called mythical time which is some schrodinger's cat of time e.g. to occultists Odin has both eyes and only one eye at once.

msg_iteration.720.user.Aryanpaganism.post.7114,1685658993,Aryanpaganism,7114,,"The essential feature of modernity is autonomy: auto-nomos, literally self-law. Everything wrong with the world comes back to man attempting to give himself law, rather than getting it from the gods. The Christian tries to do this by saying ""conscience is the voice of God"". Bad enough when the king's conscience is the voice of the god; Christianity makes every man's conscience the voice of the god. What kind of law can be based on this? What Christianity does openly, Platonism does covertly. Platonism makes every man a lawgiver by interpreting the gods' actions and commands allegorically. The worshipper must decide for himself if the deeds of Odin or Zeus are lawful. If their deeds don't meet his personal standard, they are deemed ""allegorical""; the god must have meant something different, something to be filled in, naturally, by the worshipper himself. The result is that the gods are in no position to correct us, because where we disagree, it must be ""allegory"". This is a subtle, and for that reason especially dangerous, crowning of the individual. The Enlightenment completes this self-law by simply doing away with the god. Because if the god can never correct us, even in principle, what is the difference if he doesn't exist? Don't be fooled by the toga, the tonsure, or the tri-corner hat. Whether Platonism, Christianity, or the Enlightenment, all these are just modernity.

It's the idea that moral duties only apply to our team. People who are outside the in-group are also outside moral regard. There's no room for universalism in folkishness. This may sound harsh, but it's the natural and basic worldview of Indo-Europeans. When a Dane plundered a Gaul, when a Samian plundered an Athenian, he wasn't taking something from someone, he was taking what was his, by right. There were no rights except those granted by your kin, and what rights other kin granted to themselves had no force. This doesn't mean we have to view other peoples as our enemies. We can trade with Chinese or Arabs, we can even appreciate them. But they have no rights that we don't give them. Our relations with them are bounded by what's good for us. What does this matter? There's been a lot of discussion over the years about a homeland for every people. This is a moral end we're expected to accept. The folkish worldview is that all moral ends are ends that serve my folk, and everything outside that is non-moral or practical.

msg_iteration.787.user.Aryanpaganism.post.7041,1685658993,Aryanpaganism,7041,,"The Mythology Of Universalism One of the mistakes many people in the field of comparative mythology make is erroneously using linguistics to build a cosmological framework that unifies various mythologies. Words, names, and titles are naturally polysemic; that is, they contain within them the possibility of multiple meanings. For a simple example of this, consider the word ""Tyr,"" which, depending on context, may refer to a single God, a specific god, and could even be used as a name or even a title of a god or deity. Linguistic arguments are the weakest form of argument in comparative mythology, especially when the architecture of the linguistic field is entirely based on speculation. These fields and subjects, while a serious and very helpful field of study, are entirely based on theories. It is disingenuous for anyone to claim a definitive cosmological structure by basing their assertions on a theoretical linguistic connection between two different cultures completely separated by time and geographic distance. Comparative mythologists also make a mistake by assuming correlations in mythological structures as the very basis of their methodology. Even the most rigid comparativist falls prey to confirmation bias. Instead of understanding differences, they often hyperfocus on small points of similarities that conform to their preconceived notions. Instead of understanding the belief from within the spiritual/cultural context the mythology is native too, the modern comparativist offers a theoretical worldview by automatically assuming a shared origin from the very beginning of their research into the mythology. There is no objective truth in this method of study despite what is claimed. The theories often asserted are subjective from the outset of study when the comparativist begins looking for similarities. This methodology is used to create theoretical mythologies that transform native cosmologies into a universal belief system. This method by itself is a logical fallacy. This fallacy can be likened to one seeing a field of flowers and instead of seeing a field of roses, dandelions, sunflowers etc. ; one only sees a field of flowers.",2024-03-27 05:45:06+00:00,https://t.me/Aryanpaganism/7041,,,1748,64,8,1,PeerChannel,1666781309.0,TheSacredStew,2024-03-27 01:53:17,2024-03-27,https://t.me/TheSacredStew/484,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Axial age is an influential thesis with a large body of scientific literature and empirical support, much of that literature written since the Seshat database opened a decade ago. On the ""yes there was an Axial age"" side of the ledger we have: - transition from emphasis on religious orthopraxy (rite-focused, exoteric) to orthodoxy (inward/attitude-focused, doctrinal) - transition from Weberian ""magical"" religious paradigms to Weberian ""ethical"" religious paradigms - new ""big gods"" appear (transcendent moralizing deities concerned with minute human affairs) - law/morality/religion begin to address themselves to all men - de-territorialization of religion — ""God"" is everywhere - man becomes free to choose which deity to worship — no longer bound to ethnic/tribal gods - shame culture (external, social locus of moral authority) gives way to guilt culture (internal, individual) - rise of asceticism — de-emphasis on this-worldly goods as object of highest interest - linear history appears On the ""no there wasn't an Axial age"" side we have the claim that all Indo-European religions knew ""The Absolute"". The evidence: - although clear evidence of such knowledge enters many centuries after the historical record opens (in any branch), we suspect this knowledge was hidden - related concepts (e.g. Brahman, karma) only took on the connotation of The Absolute later, but secretly they always meant this - there was a big-thing-at-the-beginning in all IE mythologies, this must have been The Absolute The comparative method is extremely powerful, but used incautiously it can also produce a lot of noise. None of what is claimed on the ""no"" side would pass muster in a real academic department. A doctorate supervisor would, right at the proposal stage, reject the thesis that the PIEs had the ""Axial acquisitions"". Even the minority of anthropologists who reject the Axial age do so not because they're trying to push neoplatonism back into the Bronze age, but for precisely the opposite reason—because too many non-IE cultures went through the same transition later. The Axial age is just the time when the list of things above happened for the first time.

This is a reductive redefinition of the term that has no historical basis. Christians can have in-group preference. But Christianity cannot be folkish. The Völkisch movement of the early 20th century grew out of German Romantic nationalism, especially the restorationist strains that sought to revive the oldest German religion. The German folk was considered a corporate entity over and above any individual, which was eternal and reached back to the dim beginnings of time. The Völkisch movement was never simply about ""racism"". It was about what is aboriginal. Folkishness is not about reviving just any old paganism. It's about reviving the oldest and strongest paganism, what was there at the very beginning of our folk. The folkish worldview purges our folk of corrupting, universalist elements that came along later, whether they be European (such as Platonism), or non-European (such as Christianity). ""Folkish universalism"" is a contradiction in terms. Universalism was not there at the beginning and it undermines the integrity of the folk.

This meme-tier view has it backwards. Christianity got more consistent over time, and the purest form of Christianity is what we have today. Early Germanic Christianity was highly impure Christianity. It was heavily mixed with pagan elements, which is why it was martial. If you could transport a bunch of Anglo Saxons around the time of Alfred to the present day, they would barely be recognizably Christian. They accepted the notion of fate. They practiced pagan burial customs, a major feature of Germanic paganism. They engaged in blood feud. They believed in elves and giants. Kings traced their lineages to Wotan. Significant elements of Aryan mythology crop up as barely disguised historical episodes. In the move from early Christianity to later times, Christianity didn't lose its essence, it purified it. That essence is anti-tradition, individualism, anti-authoritarianism, contrarianism, and in the end, atheism. @folkishworldview",2024-03-06 04:57:15+00:00,https://t.me/Aryanpaganism/6979,,,2106,12,32,1,PeerChannel,2047847238.0,folkishworldview,2024-03-05 16:53:48,2024-03-05,https://t.me/folkishworldview/185,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When asked what god is, he says god is: - That which calls upon you to make the appropriate sacrifices. - The spirit that calls the wise to prepare in the face of crisis. - The spirit that you must emulate in order to thrive. - The spirit that arises from the crowd that exists into the future.

Nilsson states: A very severe criticism of the gods and of their cult had been made by Xenophanes and Heraclitus without doing much harm.

The heretic was exiled and lived the rest of his life a wandering outcast. “Any one who shall have eaten or drank with him, or who shall have touched him,” said the law, “should purify himself.”",2024-02-13 12:05:37+00:00,https://t.me/Aryanpaganism/6916,,,3395,0,34,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From the Bronze Age to Late Antiquity, and even earlier, the entire folk community's relationship with the Immortal Pantheon depended on their recognition of their powers, their very reality. Community participation was vital. If someone's lack of faith or lack of ritual action arose, it threatened the whole community's relationship with the divine. Translated into English today, we would levy this charge of ""impiety"" against those who failed to maintain sincerity in both belief and ritual performance. In some societies, you had no choice but to participate, lest you be exiled, at the least. An example of this was demonstrated when Thervingi king Athanaric would test those Visigoths' loyalty to the Almighty by requiring them to partake in ritualized meals. Those who refused could be charged with impiety. According to the historic record, the king had approximately some 300 Goths prosecuted – and executed – for apostasizing their former convictions. They had also converted to Arian Christianity, something that Athanaric personally had declared an enemy to the very Gothic way of life. For those who say, ""You can believe whatever you want as a Pagan,"" they are simply wrong. Lack of theism, lack of acknowledgement of the sacred was not just unconventional, but a capital crime.

This was the true name, the official name, the sacred name that you bore. It was the one you were most proud of, the one that made you you. In Christian times the true, sacred name was the baptismal name, the individual name you were given at birth. Patronymics came late, as a surname or sometimes the name of the estate you were born to. For most of Christian history, you only had a first name. For Christianity, the individual is everything. Individual freedom and independence are the highest good, and your own personal relationship with Yahweh decides your salvation.

msg_iteration.991.user.Aryanpaganism.post.6822,1685658993,Aryanpaganism,6822,,"The idea that Odin was supposedly c*ckolded by Freya is often used to oppose mythic realism and needs to be dispelled. It's found in three places: Lokasenna, Saxo Grammaticus, and Ynglinga saga. Let's take a look at each: 1) Lokasenna – The slanders of Loki. Freya denies it. 2) Saxo – This is not a myth but euhemerized history. Odin and Freya are made into mortal humans by a Christian author who calls Freya a shameful woman ""unworthy to be the consort of a god"" who had sex with some unnamed servant. It's clear from the context of the passage that this Christian author means to convince his audience that Odin was not a god but some sort of magician trying to fool people into thinking he was. It was not handed down from a heathen audience and is not a real indigenous myth that our forefathers believed. 3) Ynglinga saga – This is the only source that provides us a legitimate case for this supposed infidelity. In it, Odin goes on a journey and appoints his brothers Vili and Vé to rule his kingdom in his absence. Odin is away much longer than expected and his brothers naturally presume him dead, and as a result the kingdom is divided and Freya is married off. Upon returning, Odin again takes her to wife. This is not an episode of infidelity but a quite common occurrence in traditional societies. Far from being a moral crime, it was in fact the moral duty of a brother to wed his brother's widow and support her upon his death. Every single one of you have ancestors who practiced it. So we can see that where this myth is valid at all, it's not a moral error, and far from blasphemous, it's a model of virtue. It's not a metaphor but a real event that happened.",2024-01-19 12:30:10+00:00,https://t.me/Aryanpaganism/6822,,,1971,17,20,1,PeerChannel,2047847238.0,folkishworldview,2024-01-18 02:45:42,2024-01-18,https://t.me/folkishworldview/125,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am a polytheist, and one who believes in the MANY, rather than the ONE. The problem I have with these mono/universal beliefs is that they are by their very nature dividers.

Each city-state in Greece or Rome had its birth date, the date of its founding, and this was year zero. It's hard to figure out when certain things happened by our (Christian) time reckoning, because each city started from a different date. The fact that this is hard is good. It draws a line between us and the outsider. Not only are our customs and our gods different, but even our ideas of time are different. This is how you maintain a people's integrity.

A time for feasting, goodwill, generosity to the poor, the exchange of gifts and the decoration of trees. But it wasn’t Christmas. This was Saturnalia, the pagan Roman winter solstice festival. Gaius Valerius Catullus (c. 84 - c. 54 BC) described Saturnalia as ‘the best of times’: dress codes were relaxed, small gifts such as dolls, candles and caged birds were exchanged. The wealthy were expected to pay the month’s rent for those who couldn’t afford it, masters and slaves to swap clothes. Family households threw dice to determine who would become the temporary Saturnalian monarch. From as early as 217 BC there were public Saturnalia banquets. The Roman state cancelled executions and refrained from declaring war during the festival. The earliest known reference to it commemorating the birth of Christ on December 25th is in the Roman Philocalian calendar of AD 354. ----- Full article here. @ChristianityExposed",2023-12-29 20:00:21+00:00,https://t.me/Aryanpaganism/6758,,,2187,6,20,1,PeerChannel,1683360915.0,ChristianityExposed,2023-12-29 09:07:36,2023-12-29,https://t.me/ChristianityExposed/536,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We felt that it was primitive, we were embarrassed of it. This embarrassment has made for all kinds of metaphysical speculations. The plain belief was not enough. It had to be dressed up in splendid metaphysical language. The naïve folk understanding had to be explained as just a distortion of the real truth, which the philosopher had. These metaphysical speculations were mostly harmless until they began to think they came first. They began to think that religion really did begin with these wild ideas, and the folk worldview came later. The philosophy began to feel like it could dictate to the religion, not the other way around. This is what Christians mean when they say ""logos"".

This is probably wrong. Almost certainly, paganism grew from the bottom up, from local cults into tribal and national religions rather than the other way around. It also probably grew out of highly formal, ritual practices, and the myths came from those. This might seem weird because we can reconstruct very ancient myths in common across races, but the common rites are usually much older. The inward, esoteric stuff came later, the outward forms came first. This goes against an idealized picture of paganism descending from the nobility to the plebs, but history is too messy for these simple ideals. One of the best scholars on this is Martin P. Nilsson. His book Greek Popular Religion is highly recommended, it will dispel a lot of kooky esoteric stuff about the Greeks. Ritual, ""superstition"", and the rural family are the basic shape of paganism.

These illustrations are based primarily on archaeological finds of statues and grave goods from southern and eastern Spain. Iberian civilization was one of the native cultures of western Europe, that remained after Indo-European peoples, such as the Celts, proliferated throughout, and took over most the continent. It was almost as ancient as the most ancient civilization of Europe: The Minoan Civilization of Crete and the Aegean. Cities had appeared in southern Spain as early as before 3,000 B.C. Archaeologists have found evidence that early on, Iberian culture was matriarchal; ruled by queens. It was an urban culture, heavily centered on commerce, but also reliant on agriculture, and animal husbandry. It was heavily influenced by the cultures of ancient Greece and the Phoenicians, its main partners in commerce. Both colonized the peninsula (Phoenicians founded the cities of Cádiz, Málaga, Almuñécar, Abdera, Cartagena, and possibly also Seville and Córdoba, while Greeks built Ampurias, and a city called Hemeroskopeion, the location of which is now unknown), and the Phoenicians even undertook campaigns of military conquest (237-218 B.C.). These were interrupted and reversed by the Romans in the Second Punic War, however. Celts also came in contact with Iberians from the 12th or 11th century B.C. onward, when they invaded the peninsula from France and are believed by some to have been responsible for the collapse of the bronze age Iberian Argaric Culture. Celtic influence on the Iberians included adoption of horses for warfare, new funerary rituals involving immolation of the deceased, and possibly also the switch from matriarchal governments to having polities led by men; though women continued to be prominent as priestesses.

There will be many factions, many tribalisms, no doubt, this I foresee happening anyway, just like with the future of dissident politics. Tribalism in general is on the rise, and we can expect to see a lot of this playing out for the Pagan community, mostly for the better. This is what I see developing. Still, we must confront the issue of modern Secularism in the near and distant future. Who are the biggest enemies of Paganism today? –•– By far, I identify the Universalists as the gravest threat, second only to Jews, Christians, and Muslims collectively. People and groups such as Pagan Federation, The Troth, TAC, and so forth are doing everything possibly wrong, and are using Postmodernist ideologies to attempt to bastardize what is supposed to be a natural, eternal, folk-family way of life. At the very least, some of these people have good intentions but are ultimately misguided, but, oftentimes, they know what they are doing and are committing outright blasphemous mockery, making serious people look like utter fools.

Or that they're ""living in ignorance, because if different Gods share one similarity, they must be the same God."" Usually, hard polytheism is hand waved away in favor of modern ideas of divinity, like Jungian Archetypes. Carl Jung was a christian. He viewed Pagan faith as people worshiping characters in a cosmic play. The play would play out in accordance with cultural values and things of this nature, hence variation. It's curious that he never applied the same concepts to his own religion (yahweh = sky-father, michael = striker, jesus = dying and rising, etc.). Thus, his analysis was done in bad faith.

This established the Polish-Bohemian alliance, which strengthened his grip on power. However, the Polish folk were not having it. Mieszko I and his 3 successors/descendants all faced revolts almost immediately after their coronations in 1025, 1026, and 1076. The most notable one being the ""reakcja pogańska w Polsce"" (pagan reaction in Poland) in the 1030s. Unfortunately, Mieszko I's baptism formed close ties with the Catholic Church—which up until the 12th and 13th centuries remained a foreign and unpopular establishment in Poland, imposed upon its populace by a governing elite driven by their own political and expansionist objectives—which gradually gained enough political influence to consolidate its rule over the Polish people, despite their many uprisings. @ChristianityExposed",2023-11-06 08:23:51+00:00,https://t.me/Aryanpaganism/6571,,,1665,2,13,1,PeerChannel,1683360915.0,ChristianityExposed,2023-11-06 07:59:08,2023-11-06,https://t.me/ChristianityExposed/504,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One such thing is the idea that Gods are abstract and separated from the real world i.e. what Xenophanes and later Socrates/Plato taught. In Homer's Iliad (as well as other texts) Gods are individuals. They have personal traits (even negative ones), they can interact with the world of men, have sex and even die. To Xenophanes this, despite being his tradition, was wrong. He said that both his own and foreign people (Thracians and Ethiopians) just humanize abstract divine powers. For this Xenophanes was offered either to die or to be exiled. Chose the latter. Later Socrates expressed the same views and got the same choice.

Art by Angus McBride (RIP: 1931-2007). It was Diarmait mac Murchada who brought the first English invaders over to Ireland in the year 1169, in order to recover his Kingdom of Leinster. Diarmait had been ousted by the High King of Ireland, Ruaidrí Ua Conchobar and his ally, the king of Bréifne, Tigernán Ua Ruairc; he had taken the latter’s wife in a manner similar to the Greek legend of Paris and Helen of Troy. The English invasion was initially successful in restoring Diarmait to his throne and capturing a significant part of Ireland. The native Irish were unaccustomed to the novel fighting methods of the Normans (i.e. massed volleys by Welsh archers followed by cavalry charges with heavy war horses), and the aforementioned kings and enemies of Diarmait were highly incompetent. One thing historians often understate or fail to mention altogether, however, is that the invaders relied almost entirely on native Irish allies and Welsh archers to do all of the hard fighting. One episode at an early stage in the invasion was the battle of Achadh Úr, which took place near Freshford, in county Kilkenny. Diarmait had insisted on invading the Kingdom of Ossory to take vengeance on a rival, king Donnchad mac Gilla Patraic. The invaders were initially defeated in a series of guerrilla-style attacks in the deep forests of Ossory, suffering significant losses and being forced to beat a hasty retreat. But the men of Ossory became overconfident and followed Diarmait’s army out to a district of open fields, where the Welsh were able to put their archery-volley tactics to good use; the result was a major victory for Diarmait and his allies.

msg_iteration.1527.user.Aryanpaganism.post.6222,1685658993,Aryanpaganism,6222,,"Against Christian Identity - 14 (The Hebrides are not named after the Hebrews) Within CI, there is a belief that the Hebrides (islands next to the coast of Northwest Alba) are named after the Hebrews. As with the other things that have been said, this is wrong. There are three reasons for this, which will be shared below. There is nothing in the archaeological record showing the spread of Middle Eastern ways of life into Britain during the time Christian Identitarians think the Israelites reached Britain (during the Iron Age). The blood of the folk of Britain is European, with it being West British and Irish, Continental Northern European and France IA (Gaulish blood, but it was the Belgian Gauls that reached Britain, not the Celtic Gauls.) which all come from Europe, not the Levant. Lastly, there is the reason I am writing about the Hebrides, which is that the word is not from Hebrew. The name 'Hebrides' comes from a root that is from the speech of the British Bell Beakers. Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy called these islands the 'Héboudai', meaning the 'r' came later and has nothing to do with the Hebrews. This is something known as folk etymology, which should be avoided. Since no blood likeness or leftovers of the folk living there has been shown to have strong links to the Israelites, or the Gauls, it can only be from a tongue that is not Early Hebrew, Early Gaulish or Early Irish. While the name of these islands is from a British Bell Beaker root, Roman and Greek writers wrote down Brythonic names for the Hebudes. This happened, since the most contact they had with the British was with those from outside of the Highlands and Islands. This can be known, as the blood of the Highlanders and Islanders had/has between 0% to 0.25% France IA, which is not enough for Belgian speech to have been in those bits of Britain during the Iron Age. Not only are the Hebrides not named after the Hebrews, but the Northern British (along with the Irish) have next to no 'Celtic' blood. Those in Southern Britain have more 'Celtic' blood, but this blood is from Gallia Belgica, which is not where the Celts are from. As such, it should not be called Celtic. To the British and Irish, stop thinking that you are something you are not. You are Northwest Insular Aryans, not Celts or Israelites.

Lactose intolerant people are not the same as those having a lactose allergy. At worst, lactose intolerance simply makes one gassy and gives them some stomach cramps, or in the case of young children they may vomit. Yet these retarded CI types think that having a lactose intolerance means one cannot have any lactose what so ever or they'll die. Lactose intolerant folks can still have some lactose with no ill effects. Someone with lactose intolerance can still have about 8 ounces of whole milk before they even start to feel any effects. Now most cheeses and butters have very low lactose content. This is due to the whey being largely removed, which is where the bulk of the lactose is. Of course, these retards never look into that sort of stuff. Lamentations 4:7 speaks of a people being bright and glowing but this seems to be a means on contrasting the next verse wherein they are described as black to show death. Also, they try and say that these people had the eye color of sapphire but the word ""polishing"" (as in ""their eyes had the polishing of sapphire"") means the shape or cut of the stone, not the color. Revelation 1 is also a retard take because it also describes Jesus as having a voice like rushing waters with a sword coming out of his mouth. Hardly a dependable physical description. The description by Publius Lentullus has been proven to be a forgery. The Achko Volume was a MASSIVE fraud, which the author William Dennes Mahan was tried and proven as being a liar and fraudster who claimed to have visited libraries in Rome while he was still in America, and met people who never existed yet supposedly worked at these libraries he claimed to have visited. The letter from Pontius Pilate was also proven to be a forgery. I believe this was the letter that was written in a much later dialect of Latin. The Emerald of Tiberius Caesar is an alleged reproduction of an original piece that supposedly existed but there's 0 evidence that it did. This emerald was crafted in the 19th century if memory serves me well. It is a forgery of an original which never existed.

They were a knavish lot. There is no way of knowing how many of them were actually Jews on duty for God’s Race. It is highly unlikely that any one of them was a Greek or Roman. Most of them were probably Semites or descendants of one of the other Oriental peoples that swarmed into the mongrelised Roman Empire and displaced or replaced the Romans. Whatever their racial antecedents, it is clear from their own writings, despite much later whitewashing, that they were a motley crew of shysters, psychopaths, and other misfits.

Growing up my family identified as Catholic, some relatives were Christians, but we never went to church or prayed at the dinner table. We only went there for weddings or funerals, I was told God existed and he would help you when needed. Throughout my life I never felt close or wanted to be a part of the church and religion. The last 5 years or so I found and embraced my true roots of Paganism and learning about my ancestors, Gods/Goddesses and our folk. I truly feel at home and the Pagan community is one of the best at helping you with any questions you have. What is Paganism to me? Paganism is what we were born with inside of us, it is nature, it is life and the true belief system of Europeans and descendants of European folk. I try not to see it as a religion but an embodiment of what we are, were and will always be. It is the true belief system of White (Aryan) peoples, it's what makes us stronger in life.

In doing so, they remove their agency as tribal Gods in lieu of an incomprehensible and stagnant uniformity.

To neglect the importance of these traditions is to forsake the very essence that animates a folk's spirit and the primal force that drives the preservation of a people. It is within the embrace of this collective heritage that we discover the true source of our purpose and meaning, for true triumph emerges from the interconnected web of collective solidarity, casting a shadow over the fleeting ambitions of solitary souls. We must, therefore, condemn all universalistic cults that transcend ethnic boundaries—such as Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism—for they will inevitably erode this profound essence entrenched within the fabric of one's ethnic being, diminishing all individuals entangled in their grasp into a lifeless fusion, devoid of the very vitality that inspires our indomitable pursuit of greatness. @ChristianityExposed",2023-08-05 10:53:50+00:00,https://t.me/Aryanpaganism/5993,,,1394,0,15,1,PeerChannel,1683360915.0,ChristianityExposed,2023-08-04 06:33:46,2023-08-04,https://t.me/ChristianityExposed/443,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also Paganism encouraged me to take batter care of my health, even though by that time I already quit boxing and had the traumas I struggle with to this day.

Whereupon, I began to fully appreciate the immortal Gods of my ancestors—of the Germans and the Celts.

After its initial discovery, locals had imagined it as a depiction of a mythical reptilian monster known as “La Tarasque”; hence the name given to it. But more careful recent observations have led to the conclusion that the statue was meant to represent a wolf: The long snout, thick hair along the back, non-retractable claws, and a broad, tapering tail (tucked under the right leg), are all traits characteristic of a wolf. The Noves wolf sits upright like a king, grimly enjoying a meal of human flesh and triumphantly displaying the severed heads of two victims, in classic Celtic warrior fashion. The long beards on the victims’ faces appear to imply that they were intended as members of nobility, perhaps even as kings. The ancient stonemasons carved a penis and testicles onto the wolf, probably to leave no room for doubt as to its intended gender (there are only two), as well as to emphasize the attribute of virility.

msg_iteration.2118.user.Aryanpaganism.post.5539,1685658993,Aryanpaganism,5539,,"In spite of all the thundering curses against homosexuality in the Bible, it seems that Jesus and some of his disciples may have actually had homosexual relationship. Note the highly suspicious passages that follow: Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified, ‘Very truly I tell you, one of you is going to betray me.’ His disciples stared at one another, at a loss to know which of them he meant. One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to him. Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, ‘Ask him which one he means.’ Leaning back against Jesus, he asked him, ‘Lord, who is it? The fact that we are told that Christ loved this disciple clues us in to the fact that this love was of a different variety than what he showed to the other disciples. Thus, can we be faulted for concluding that a homosexual relationship was being implied here? Such speculation, to a Christian, is nothing short of ""blasphemy"".

Since the 15th century, the day has been celebrated in memory of the “German saint St. Walpurgis.” Valborg was canonized on May 1 (which was then celebrated as Walborg Fair, Walpurgistag), and through this circumstance her name was associated with the pre-Christian Germanic spring festivals held on this day, which were branded by Christianity as witches' assemblies. Today Valborg is a celebration of spring and light from the warming and bright sun. Valborg is still celebrated with a large bonfire and it’s common for both children and adults to dance around it.

The inscription on the Snoldelev Stone shows an early version of the Younger Futhark. Like the late Elder Futhark Björketorp Runestone, it uses an a-rune, which has the same form as the h-rune has in the long-branch version of the younger futhark. The Snoldelev runestone also retains the elder futhark hagalaz rune for the h-phoneme. Another feature from the elder futhark is the use of the ansuz rune, which is here specifically used to symbolize a long nasal a, often transcribed as ""á"" which is similar but not identical to its Scandinavian descendant ""å"". The last character in the runic text is damaged, but is clearly a maðr rune and represents the first use of this rune for an 'm' in Denmark.

Nowadays you have to learn everything yourself and even when you do the majority still won’t listen because they can’t check whether you are trustworthy. As a result fakes and shills end up praised as great godis, volkhvs etc because the masses don’t bother reading the sources and that’s not even their fault, after all the average Joe is not supposed to be an expert.

msg_iteration.2193.user.Aryanpaganism.post.5452,1685658993,Aryanpaganism,5452,,"To complain about the use of the word ""Aryan"" because of the belief that it's not what they called themselves, or that it's a term misplaced because of modernity, is to ignore the fact that the Indo-Europeans certainly did not call themselves ""Indo-Europeans"", either. That's most definitively a modern term (and one that doesn't even make sense). The PIIs didn't call themselves ""Aryans"", either, that's an English word. They called themselves by words related to that word, but existing in different forms in their own language. Even if ""Aryan"" comes only from Indo-Iranian, to use it for ""Indo-European"" cuts to the heart of what's implied and even being communicated when we discuss things such as the Aryan Invasion: that the invaders did not spring up out of the ground like mushrooms, that they weren't self-contained. It casts the Aryan Invasion in a very specific light, and tethers them directly to their ancestors from the Pontic-Caspian Steppe, connected by blood and language to other Indo-Europeans. It does more good to present them as they were: descendants of their fathers, and kin to whom they are, then it does to have something self-contained. The term has always been, rightly, the ""Aryan Invasion"", not the ""Indo-European Invasion"", which would be necessary to achieve the same effect, because ""IE Invasion"" would be self-referential and itself very confusing. The Indo-Iranians, coming as Aryans, distinguished from the Dravidians, and speakers of other languages in the region, did not exist on their own, but sourced their culture from their IE fathers. As such, I think it's useful to take their ethnonym and see it as stemming, whether in fact or in spirit, from their fathers. They get who they are; they get their Aryan-ness, from their fathers, and if they do, I say we do too. Critiques about it being as if we were to call the English ""Americans"", or the Beakers ""Romans"", also fail: those names are ridiculous because they're tied to geography; to specific places. ""Aryan"" is not like that, and never was. The way to de-stigmatize the term is just to use it exactly how it's normally used when scholars of Indo-Iranic do their little song-and-dance when introducing the term, or to not even bother. Desensitize people to the term through proper use, in contexts where the Indo-Europeans are discussed, with no mention made of Hitler or National Socialism. Just plough ahead that way, and the term will be redeemed in the eyes of the general public. ""Aryan"" is so much more versatile than the clunky, and hardly accurate, ""Indo-European"". It gets around all sorts of other problems, such as terminological disputes about ""Eastern Europe"" versus ""Eurasia"", or ""Indo-Hittite"" versus ""Indo-European"". Being a self-contained, self-referential term makes it impervious to those sorts of goofy games. Imagine a conversation between two people: ""So, Indo-European languages are spoken in the range between India & Europe?"" ""Well, no, the range is broken up by Mongolic, Turkic, Semitic, Kartvelian and other types of languages."" ""Oh, well, it's spoken in all of India, then?"" ""No."" ""All of Europe, surely?"" ""No."" ""Just Europe and India, though, right?"" ""No... they're also spoken across the Americas, Oceania, Southern Africa, and other colonial locales, too. They're also spoken in West Asia and the Caucasus. Historically, they were also spoken in Anatolia, the Altai, Tibet, and other places outside the geographic belt running from Europe to India"" ""Why do you call the languages 'Indo-European', then?""

To call the ancestors of the Vedic people (funny how that term just works, and works because it's narrow) ""Aryans"", as well as to call the Iranics ""Aryans"" (which I've heard done before); i.e., with the same term, implies to a reasonable person that they are part of the same narrow subgroup, and they're not. There's a cleft, and it's wrong to conflate them. So, if ""Aryan"" is to be used for the ancestral group, it should not be used for descendant groups, in English. Obviously in II languages themselves, the reconstructed root, *Áryas, will pass through the sound change laws present in each respective tongue, so there won't be any confusion, but in English, it can certainly give the wrong impression. If one attempts to justify this by pleading the reconstructed ethnonym, one has to realize this is special pleading, because one is making an unjustified statement about the reality of the word in PIE itself. If it's okay to call all peoples in the II linguistic horizon as ""Aryans"" in English because of the reconstructed name of their ancestors, bearing in mind that this would make it okay to call the Nuristanis (whose branch sustains no descendant) and other modern II peoples who don't use a descendant term to refer to themselves (such as Kurds, Marathis, Jats, Pashtuns, etc.) as such, then it stands to reason that anybody who comes from such a descendant population should be fit to be called ""Aryans"", or ""the descendants of Aryans"", whether or not they currently refer to themselves in such a manner. In other words, if it's okay to call all the Indo-Iranics ""Aryans"" because of reconstruction, one is inherently implying that the reconstruction for PIE is a false one, which I don't believe it to be. In any case, it can't be definitively proved that it's not, and the term has come to have connotations in English, which I'll reference again later. We already use synonyms & cognates to describe the speakers of II languages which I think can continue; if people know ""Iranian"" comes from a word which means ""Aryan"", descending from a root in that language, I think they can understand that a similar term, contrived in English, can mean the same thing. That solves the problem right there while salvaging the history of the word in English, and the meaning it's acquired in the minds of so many; a meaning I hardly think is unjustified. The use of words is the heart and essence of descriptivism. Anyway, to my point here: There's no reason we couldn't come up with a term like ""Ahryan"" (capitalizing on the pronunciation some people prefer), Ariosic, Aryasic, Irasic, Arisic, Aryamanic, Vedo-Iranic, Asian Aryan, Classical Aryan, etc. I think Indo-Iranian works fine itself for English speakers, and I use it myself precisely because I don't want to conflate different subgroups of that category. I use ""Aryan"" in the sense that it connotes ""Indo-European"" only; ""Aryan"" should be used to connote a specifically Indo-European sense, or cast things in that specific comparative or ur light.",2023-04-13 17:45:15+00:00,https://t.me/Aryanpaganism/5451,,,1813,1,21,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msg_iteration.2195.user.Aryanpaganism.post.5450,1685658993,Aryanpaganism,5450,,"I don't think the reasoning given for opposing the use of the term ""Aryan"" in place of ""Indo-European"" makes sense. First, it actually represents a departure from the norms of how things are normally grandfathered in as terms for use. I assume, therefore, to be consistent, we would also have to embrace ""Syro-Arabian"" over ""Semitic"", as the Bible, the source for the name of Shem, also lists the Canaanites (a Semitic-speaking people) as being descendants of Ham, and unrelated to Shem? Likewise, we'd have to abandon ""Iberomaurusian"", ""Hittite"", ""Germanic"", ""Tocharian"", ""Paleoindian"", and others, even though people don't get confused by those terms? ""Aryan"" is an English term. It's an English word, learned from Indo-Iranian, but not borrowed straight out of it. It's also reconstructed (and lacks a Nuristani cognate, as it so happens) from the available evidence, but as many academics & independent researchers alike have pointed out, the word likely does go back to PIE. Saying that we can't take the word ""Aryan"" because of its specific presence in Indo-Iranian/PII reminds me of Muslims who say that we can't spell the word for their holy book as ""Koran"". Any complaints by them are irrelevant: the word in Arabic is ""اَلْقُرْآنُ‎""; therefore, it's never a misspelling to present it, Romanized, as ""Koran"" anymore than it is ""Quran"" or ""Qur'an"". Similarly, the word in Sanskrit is ""आर्य"" (to give one example from the II languages), but ""Aryan"" in English is not even a transliteration, so it makes less sense than it does for the Muslims to quibble about the representation of the word for their holy book, because ""Aryan"" is a derived term, intended to be functional, useful, and descriptive in English: the word may be what it is in a given II language, but we Anglophones have decided to take it and present it how we have for our own purposes, something untethered to them, their uses, and their feelings on the matter. It's not a perfect analogy, but I hope I've made my point. We're not bound by their linguistic rules or what they understand certain words to mean or imply. Oftentimes nowadays, the people are simply called ""Indic"" or ""Vedic"" for that branch, and it works out just fine. The Iranics/Iranians are called as such, and it works out just fine. Those terms are robust and useful in English, and don't need ""Aryan"" to clear them up. Indeed, to call them ""Indo-Iranic"" is to actually conform to how the sub-branches are usually/more-often-than-not termed: Balto-Slavic, Germanic, Italic, Celtic, Hellenic. It's true that some branches, like Anatolian, don't employ that nomenclature format, but ""Indo-Iranic"" does conform to it, and I think it works just fine. There is no good reason to insist on ""Aryan"" for the PIIs or IIs, over ""Indo-Iranic"" to begin with, because ""Aryan"" already has baggage, and those other terms have utility. It already comes with disclaimers about how ""silly"" Hitler was to use the term, yada yada, and because the word is still retains an outside use, or even sees the bulk of its use, amongst NS people/racialists today, every time they hear that word, people are going to feel the ""bite"", and a portion of the audience will always be thinking about the Nazis. If that's the case, and scholars muscle through with its use anyway, then I don't see the purpose in needing to avoid it for the whole groups, especially since the whole song-and-dance with the Nazis will be done anyway, Nazis will remain on people's minds anyway, and the term will see its use retained among modern-day NS folks anyway. If we're going to bother, we should go all the way.",2023-04-13 17:45:15+00:00,https://t.me/Aryanpaganism/5450,,,1916,4,34,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It details some of the motiffs of a living, naturalistic relgion and worldview combined into a way of life and connection to existence, rather than as an individual marching on some path of time to a defined end goal. This is especially true with regards to the Christian and Liberal narrative of existence, as linear time with an end goal of progress towards a set directive, whereby the trials and tribulations of the world will end and a utopia outside of space and time will be achieved. Despite this, of course there are reservations about the Ásatrú Society. Namely, they're led by an eccletic occultist with roots in the anti-ethnic, leftist movements and countercultures of the 1960s, who had this to say: It is much the same with Ásatrú, and Hilmar points especially to some North American Ásatrú practitioners as taking the wrong stance towards the relationship between tradition and evolution. “These people,” he says, “they want to hit you over the head with the Eddas. They quote the poetry like scripture.” These people, those who want to worship a frozen past, are also generally those on the political fringes. Hilmar does not have much to say about them except that “they run around and speak pidgin Icelandic. This idea, that it has to be in your bloodstream, that it’s ethnic or genetic, it’s ridiculous.” So, we have a man claiming to lead religious communities made up entirely of Icelanders in Iceland, telling Americans in particular, but including any ethnic reconstructionists in Europe too, that saying something along the lines of, ""My religion and worldview is dependent on my background as a Teutonic person, so no you cannot join in the worship of my ancestors if they are not your ancestors"" is akin to blasphemy in his view; that such a statement would never have been uttered. Fortunately for us, and sadly for the sake of Hilmar's scholastic integrity, such a view is the natural default of all ethnic peoples on this planet and remained ours as well even after we converted en masse to Christianity in the Middle Ages. Only with the late onset of the Liberal Enlightenment did many ideas of ethnicity and singular foci of a path for one's people become verbotten and discouraged. One can even look at the German Empire, United States, Kingdom of Italy, and others until the post-World War I period to see that an ethnic sense of identity and purpose worked hand in hand with parliamentarian government, secular judicial institutions, and technological advancements. The idea that ethnicity can or should ever be divided from a religion, a people, and their choice of direction for the future, is an idea devised in the minds of hostile alien groups trying to carve out a space for themselves and their group inside the otherwise homogenous body of their host.",2023-03-31 06:30:56+00:00,https://t.me/Aryanpaganism/5403,,,1326,3,7,1,PeerChannel,1362071273.0,,2023-03-20 14:29:00,2023-03-20,,0,,,1,MessageMediaWebPage,1,https://www.icelandreview.com/magazine/paganpoetry/?fbclid=IwAR2MvA8JPwq3nN2ICQHNy8vr8dWe-sb0vBs7xuRRcbVSnOq6p4vXjxkpI8s,icelandreview.com,Pagan Poetry,"Iceland's fastest growing religious organisation is a version of the old Norse belief system - Ásatrú, adapted for the modern age.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite great powers and craftiness chorts often get tricked by the protagonist or an old wise man/woman the latter consults.",2023-03-07 21:27:40+00:00,https://t.me/Aryanpaganism/5288,,,1767,2,17,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Godan, the name by which they called ""Odin,"" was the main deity of their Germanic Pantheon. According to legend, the ruler of the Longobards, ""Gambara,"" asked Odin's wife Frigg for help to win in battle against the Vandals. Odin decreed that he would give victory to the people who would see first on the morning of the battle. Frigg gave the Longobards the advice to present themselves on the battlefield at sunrise: men and women together, these with their hair down to below their chins like beards. At sunrise Frigg caused Odin to turn to the side of the Winnili, and the god, when he saw them, asked, ""Who are those with the long beards?"" To which the goddess replied, ""Since you have given them a name, give them victory as well."" Hence their ethnonym: ""It is commonly said that the Lombards were so called because of their long beards, which were never cut"" (Isidore of Seville, Etymologiae, IX, 2, 95) Longobards: the beloved sons of Godan, the valiant conquering soldiers, the warriors who earned the golden pome of victory with ardor in battle. They repopulated Cisalpine and were the last serious wave of migration to form the ethnicity of today's Lombards, so much so that the overlap of Cisalpine Gaul with Langbard creates our territory, our identity and our ethno-cultural heritage.

In Russian his remarks sounded particularly insulting. It brought an avalanche of enraged response from thousands of Russians (mainly on the internet, because we are not allowed to protest on the street). This “Russian” patriarch made many other anti-Russian remarks and called for more vigorous state measures against “neo-Nazis.” Kirill is a genuine Christian and expresses what he was taught.

This battle took place near Talamone, in Tuscany, Italy. 🇮🇹 War broke out after Roman colonization projects encroached on Gallic lands in northern Italy. The Italian Gauls launched the first offensive with an army that included the Gaesatae, mercenaries from the Swiss Alps, known for fighting as “naked fanatics”. They defeated a Roman army at the Battle of Faesulae, but were then caught between two larger armies led by consuls L. Aemilius Papus & G. Atilius Regulus. Outnumbered and surrounded, they put up a heroic fight to the death and inflicted mass casualties on the Romans; the consul Regulus was among the slain, while the Gaesatae leader Concolitanus was wounded and captured. Some of the Gaesatae managed to break through the Roman lines. When overtaken later and surrounded by Roman cavalry, they all committed suicide rather than surrender, including their leader Aneroëstes.

Is Europe Christian-pagan? No, Europe is pagan, Christianity is an imported semitic allogenic element: the Christus Rex, Christus Sol, is nothing but a paganization, a gentilization that completely distorts the original desert Christianity. Christianity is foreign, Catholicism has Romanized Christianity with gentile elements nonexistent in true Christianity: hierarchy, Christians were persecuted precisely because they were enemies of hierarchy, the Imperium and slavery.

Christianity is the enemy of the pagan European spirit; it has been Rome's greatest enemy. Christianity destroyed the spirit, the Roman ethos of glory and aristocracy, the Jew infiltrated and subverted the empire from within through Paul the Jew <<Christian missionaries began to be active in Iceland by 980. One of them was the Icelandic native Thorvald Konradsson, who had been baptized on the continent by the Saxon bishop Fridrek, with whom he preached the gospel in Iceland in 981, converting only Thorvald's father Konrad and his family. They were unsuccessful and even had a clash with pagans at the Althing, killing two men. After the event, in 986 Fridrek returned to Saxony while Thorvald embarked for Viking expeditions in Eastern Europe. Among the other proselytisers, King Olaf of Norway sent the Icelandic native Stefnir Thorgilsson in 995-996 and the Saxon priest Thangbrand in 997-999. Both the missions were unsuccessful: Stefnir violently destroyed temples and ancestral shrines, leading the Althing to enact a law against Christians-who were declared frændaskomm, a ""disgrace on one's kin,"" and could now be denounced-and to outlaw Stefnir, who returned to Norway; Thangbrand, a learned but violent man, succeeded in converting some important families, but he also had many opponents, and, when he killed a poet-who had composed verses against him-, he was outlawed and he too went back to Norway. [...] it was difficult for individuals to convert to Christianity, since it would have meant to abandon the traditions of one's own kin, and would have been seen as ættarspillar-""destruction of kinship."" >> In essence, Christian missionaries were often violent, destroyed temples and statues of deities, and above all denied ancestral (ancestor) worship, threatening the integrity and historical continuity of the social fabric. At one point in Iceland they were declared by law frændaskomm, ""disgrace to the lineage"" Conversion to Christianity was considered ættarspillar, ""destruction of the lineage”",2023-02-07 18:40:55+00:00,https://t.me/Aryanpaganism/5154,,,1539,21,30,1,PeerChannel,1866594415.0,,2023-02-07 08:38:21,2023-02-07,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the contrary, starting from the idea that the sacred no longer belongs to Christianity, it is the solemn affirmation of transcendence. Europe is more Pagan than ever, while it still searches for its roots which are not the Judeo-Christian ones. The dictatorship of Christian ideology could not stifle the ancient values, but only pushed them in the darkness of the subconscious.

I do not believe that they were raiding for self gain, it was a direct response to Christianity and the threat that they recognised. There is a reason why they went for the churches and monasteries first. Near where I live, the Vikings destroyed the cathedral. Their leader, a prince named Thorkill, who came with 66 ships, turned the cathedral into a Temple for Thor and made his wife Priestess. There are many stories like this. I consider that a heroic act. The people of Dublin were named ""The people of Thor"" after the Viking invasions. There was a large, sacred grove planted in Dublin which was destroyed by the traitor Brian Boru. The Vikings were not the savages depicted on TV shows, they were Asatruar who understood the importance of honour and bloodlines. I do not believe the manipulated history books when they try to convince us that the invasions were for riches, or even for farmland. as Irish soil is full of stones. Even today, Denmark has 59% arable land compared to 6% in Ireland! 1066 was the worst catastrophe ever experienced in the British isles. The Normans were traitors. They executed all of the natural anglo-saxon noble class and replaced them with Z*onists and their supporters.

msg_iteration.2603.user.Aryanpaganism.post.4985,1685658993,Aryanpaganism,4985,,"1. Thor has a flaming red beard and blue/grey eyes. This is corroborated in all sagas and folklore. He is a Teutonic god, unique to our people going back to at least the Nordic Bronze Age. It is absurd that he would appear otherwise than do our people; being fair skinned, light eyed, and fair haired. 2. ""Norse Paganism"" is a fake label. All Teutonic cultures valued women in their duties, roles, femininity, motherhood, and sacral positions. All Northern European cultures do so, only Abrahamic religions treat women as chattel. Women were not ""empowered"" to be whores, layabouts, traitors, or men though. All these things were forbidden to ensure social harmony and the legal protection of women, and the latter only occured with an extremely small handful of female warriors, and never as warlords over men, whereas acting against your sex's roles was expressly forbidden. Germania and the sagas of Iceland speak explicitly about these things. 3. None of the gods are immigrants. The Vanir and Aesir fought a war over who would rule supreme, they were rival tribes, and this is an archetype dating back into earliest prehistory, because tribal conflict is a part of life. Ingroups vs outgroups. Not to mention the gods and giants and other spirits all represent natural forces and facets of human nature, one cannot ascribe human level politics to the myths. Grimm and the Poetic Edda make this quite clear, as does Dumezil in his study of Aryan religions. 4. There are no faggot gods. Loki comes closest and he is the most villanous, treacherous, and reviled figure in all of Teutonic lore. Again, the gods and giants and other spirits all represent natural forces and facets of human nature, one cannot ascribe human level deviances to the myths. Germania explicitly states that homosexuals were killed for their actions, men were executed for rape, adulterous women were exiled, and the Norse law codes explicitly state being called ""ergi"" (passive homosexual) was grounds for starting a blood feud that eventually consume all of your and the aggrevator's family for generations. 5. Abortion was extremely uncommon after the first trimester in ancient times. It was understood and accepted that a woman would take herbs and teas to bring on a period if they had been sexually assaulted or were out of wedlock. It was also accepted that deformed and sickly offspring would be exposed and die. This was all to ensure the eugenic survival and thriving of the tribe and individual woman, not so women could have indiscriminate sex as degenerates and then murder their potential offspring. Freya and Frigg are both goddesses of sexuality, love, honor, commitment, marriage, childrearing, childbirth, growth, fertility, and motherhood. It is obscene to ascribe the modern liberal use of abortion and sexual degeneracy to goddesses such as these. 6. Of course not. Chivalry was an honor code that developed out of Northern European morals, laws, and religion. Dishonorable warriors were treated harshly, as were men who started blood feuds. There are many accounts of dishonorable men and warriors being harshly treated throughout the sagas, Germania, the Gesta Danorum, etc.",2023-01-08 07:02:43+00:00,https://t.me/Aryanpaganism/4985,,,1576,3,40,1,PeerChannel,1362071273.0,,2023-01-07 17:50:12,2023-01-07,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tradition was also often called ""Mother Night"" and is celebrated just a few days before the wheel is turning - the Winter Solstice. ❄️ Lucia is a tradition held to welcome the return of the light and is a symbol of a light-bringing female. Earlier back in the days, women of each tribe climbed the highest hill or mountain in the area dressed in white and light to watch the horizon for a sign of the light returning. This has it's original origins from the pagan light-goddesses Frigg and Sól - Sunna, and the red belt around the waist of Lucia symbolize fertility...- continues in comment below! ⬇️ Follow @NativeScandinavia 🌲 https://www.instagram.com/p/CmGnrPJtF0u/?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY=",2022-12-15 08:53:49+00:00,https://t.me/Aryanpaganism/4859,,,1097,0,15,1,PeerChannel,1521283262.0,NativeScandinavia,2022-12-13 10:17:52,2022-12-13,https://t.me/NativeScandinavia/212,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them?» - 1 Corinthians 15:29.

Platonism is a transcendental and universalist proposition. This is completely incompatible with Heathen and foundational IE theology at large. Heathenry is natural and determined with a clear immanent understanding of cosmology. When the myths say that you die, go to Hel for judgement and then are later reincarnated, you can't then apply a philosophy that says the opposite. That by definition is a heretical understanding of the sources. Platonists get around this by saying that the myths are just metaphors. Myths are the inherited story of a race of people. If the myths don't matter then our creation doesn't matter and then who we are as a people doesn't matter. It's only a step away from gender, borders and race don't matter. The Plato to Christianity to Liberalism to woke deathcult pipeline is objectively the case. Obviously Plato is a much more sympathetic figure than the freaks having transgender throuples today but the lineage is there. Universalism is 100% heretical to the heathen worldview. One universal truth, one universal morality is the foundation that globalism and transhumanism stands on. Which is the opposite of our Germanic ancestors who were fiercly tribal. Heathens don't need Platonism. All of the important questions of the human experience can be answered within heathen sources. At best it's a distraction and at worst it's completely incompatible in places. Also Socrates was literally executed for heresy. https://t.me/survivethejive/3755",2022-11-18 17:21:26+00:00,https://t.me/Aryanpaganism/4682,,,1066,36,16,1,PeerChannel,1480659624.0,TheBoglord,2022-11-18 16:50:02,2022-11-18,https://t.me/TheBoglord/2849,0,,,1,MessageMediaWebPage,1,https://t.me/survivethejive/3755,t.me,Survive the Jive: All-feed,"My view on Platonism among Heathens is simple. No one can claim that a heathen has to be a Platonist or that if allowed to continue, heathens would have adopted platonic philosophy just as every other religion in the West did. We can't know that. Therefore we cannot scorn those heathens who reject Platonism. Also, no one can claim Platonism is a heresy among Heathens as nothing like this is expressed anywhere by any heathen source. In fact what we know about Germanic heathens is that they were extremely flexible, allowing the incorporation of Lappish shamanism, and even Christianity and idols of Christ in temples (at least in some cases). People on either side trying to establish an orthodox dogma which opposes the other are being dishonest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar in Heimskringla, Sigríðr objects, ""I will not turn from the faith that I have held formerly, and my kinsmen before me"". In the first two stanzas of the sequence, Hallfreðr is similarly reluctant to reject the past and the poetic tradition he has inherited from his forefathers.

The curiously gnomic statement ""skipt es á gumna giptu"" in the first stanza may be read as ""the good luck of men has changed"", an expression of stoic resignation to these events, but it may also connote a sense of division on the part of the poet from those who do not or cannot place their allegiance in Christ: if the verb skipta is taken to mean ""to divide, to separate"", the phrase may be translated as ""the fortunes of men have divided"".

Both have the same ideological impetus behind them, and that is ethnocultural Marxism. The seizure and redistribution of our bio-culture to impostors is framed as something virtuous. It’s no surprise that vulnerably narcissistic leftists are the driving force behind the “diversity, inclusivity, and equity” agenda, part of which focuses on the vandalization of European bio-culture. Nonwhite vulnerable narcissists support this vandalization because they hate Europeans and envy who we are, what we’ve created, and what we possess, and they want to possess those things for themselves. White vulnerable narcissists support this vandalization because they are hypersensitive to social isolation and rejection, have an excessive desire for approval, have persistent feelings of shame, and hate those who they consider dominant over them and other people they perceive as vulnerable. Condemning and boycotting the enemy’s propaganda is a good start, but it’s not nearly enough. The only way to protect ourselves and our history is to secure autonomy and self-determination, an environment where the people who want to dispossess and destroy us are not those who are in control of our cultural institutions.

As though, for a Hellene, there could be any foreign land holier than Greece!"" I went back to Greece. I tried to speak.

One was Dionysus, who was believed by the Greeks to be the son of Zeus—the ""father of the gods."" In other words, Dionysus was considered to be the ""son of god,"" or the ""son of the father."" His mother was a mortal named Semele, who was supernaturally impregnated by Zeus. And—get this—the followers of Dionysus were claimed to have been ""born again."" Dionysus, like Christ, was a traveling teacher and he was alleged to be the god of wine. This wine attachment is also observed with Christ, who placed a considerable emphasis on wine in the ceremonial ""Lord's Supper"" and, of course, wine was the theme behind the ""miracle"" of turning water into wine at the Cana wedding feast. ----- From: What Is Wrong With the Bible? by Charles Giuliani. @ChristianityExposed",2022-09-25 13:14:18+00:00,https://t.me/Aryanpaganism/4115,,,1107,0,6,1,PeerChannel,1683360915.0,ChristianityExposed,2022-09-25 09:55:34,2022-09-25,https://t.me/ChristianityExposed/237,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initially, the word ethnikos was used in the Bible to refer to pagans, meaning those of the ethnic faith, and the word gentile derives from the Latin gentilis, meaning ""clan"" or ""tribe"". Catholic, however, derives from the Greek katholikos, meaning ""universal"", for we ""are all one in Christ Jesus"" (Gal 3:28). The purpose of Abrahamism is and always has been the universal worship of ""the God of Israel"" (Isa 45:3) and therefore the Jews—his ""treasured possession"" who were ""chosen out of all the peoples"" (Deut 7:6)—by proxy.

In reality, Scythians had varying levels of East Asian admixture, ranging from 0% in Europe to 50% in the Altai regions. They were not a homogeneous ethnic group. They can be roughly divided into three genetic clusters: 1. Western Scythians, who were near-identical to modern Eastern Europeans. 2. Central Scythians (Sarmatians, Cimmerians, Tian Shan Sakas, Tagar, etc), most closely related to modern Russians, Finnic peoples (e.g. Udmurts), and Pamiri Tajiks. 3.
