The task of dialectics is to establish when such critical points emerge. For the last 10 or 20 years all the contradictions have been accumulating on a world scale. Now we see the results. In the history of the world since 1945 never have we seen such tremendous convulsions at all levels: economic, social, diplomatic and political. Never have the contradictions of the capitalist system been so clearly expressed in every part of the globe. The present situation on a world scale resembles what is called a critical state in physics, where particles are subject to the wildest fluctuations. This creates certain difficulties for perspectives, which in the previous period were more predictable. Just as it is relatively easy to predict the laminar flow of a liquid, but difficult to predict the outcome of turbulence, so the world situation, balanced on the edge of chaos, can produce all kinds of surprises, both for the ruling class and for the Marxists. https://www.marxist.com/molecular-process-world-revolution1180804.htm **Text 2005",2023-07-02 15:57:38+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/29648,,,612,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaWebPage,1,https://www.marxist.com/molecular-process-world-revolution1180804.htm,marxist.com,The molecular process of World Revolution,"The present document deals mainly with the world economy, with particular attention being paid to the position of the USA and the growing power of China.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.29942.user.Davidscave.post.29579,1620420179,Davidscave,29579,,"""Twinkie defense"" is a derisive label for an improbable legal defense. It is not a recognized legal defense in jurisprudence, but a catch-all term coined by reporters during their coverage of the trial of defendant Dan White for the murders of San Francisco city Supervisor Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone. White's defense was that he suffered diminished capacity as a result of his depression, a symptom of which was a change in diet from healthy food to Twinkies and other sugary foods. Contrary to common belief, White's attorneys did not argue that the Twinkies were the cause of White's actions, but that their consumption was symptomatic of his underlying depression. The product itself was only mentioned in passing during the trial. White was convicted of voluntary manslaughter rather than first-degree murder, and served five years in prison.https://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Myth-of-the-Twinkie-defense-The-verdict-in-2511152.php",2023-07-01 18:32:10+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/29579,,,970,2,11,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Piacenza liver is a striking conceptual parallel to clay models of sheep's livers known from the Ancient Near East, reinforcing the evidence of a connection (be it by migration or merely by cultural contact) between the Etruscans and the Anatolian cultural sphere. The outer rim of the Piacenza liver is divided into 16 sections; since according to the testimony of Pliny and Cicero, the Etruscans divided the heavens into 16 astrological houses, it has been suggested that the liver is supposed to represent a model of the cosmos, and its parts should be identified as constellations or astrological signs. Each of the 16 houses was the ""dwelling place"" of an individual deity. Seers would e.g. draw conclusions from the direction in which lightning was seen.",2023-06-30 13:14:46+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/29497,,,601,0,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, models of sheep livers used by priests were found in Mesopotamia as well as in Italy. According to Osler, ''of all the organs inspected in a sacrificial animal, the liver, from its size, position, and richness in blood, impressed the early observers as the most important of the body''. The liver probably came to be considered as the seat of life and the soul because of its rich- ness in blood.",2023-06-30 13:14:27+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/29496,,,581,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted an etymological analysis of the terms used to indicate ""liver"" in Germanic and Romance languages. The Greek word ""hèpar"" was originally connected to the concept of ""pleasure"", showing that in antiquity the liver was considered to be the seat of soul and human feelings. In Romance languages, the Latin term ""ficatum"" was linked to the ancient practice of fattening geese with figs (ficus in Latin) to make their livers more delicious. This relationship between the liver, fat, and carbohydrates seems to indicate that ancient gourmets had clear knowledge of the nutritional mechanisms underlying ""fatty liver"" in animals. On the other hand, the Germanic term ""lifere"" was initially connected to ""life"", underscoring the relation of the liver to health and existence. In the Early Modern Age, the liver became a recurring image in political reflection, especially within the Elizabethan tradition of the body politic, where the king was frequently described as the ""liver"" of his country.",2023-06-30 13:13:54+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/29495,,,601,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1527, Michael Sattler presided over a meeting at Schleitheim (in the Canton of Schaffhausen, on the Swiss-German border), where Anabaptist leaders drew up the Schleitheim Confession of Faith. Anabaptists believe that baptism is valid only when candidates freely confess their faith in Christ and request to be baptized. This believer's baptism is opposed to baptism of infants, who are not able to make a conscious decision to be baptized. Anabaptists trace their heritage to the Radical Reformation of the 16th century. Other Christian groups with different roots also practice believer's baptism, such as Baptists, but these groups are not Anabaptist.

He also tended to support the centralization and urbanization of the economy. This position alienated the lesser nobles, but shored up his position with the burghers. Luther argued that work was the chief duty on earth; the duty of the peasants was farm labor and the duty of the ruling classes was upholding the peace. He could not support the Peasant War because it broke the peace, an evil he thought greater than the evils the peasants were rebelling against. At the peak of the insurrection in 1525, his position shifted completely to support of the rulers of the secular principalities and their Roman Catholic allies. In Against the Robbing Murderous Hordes of Peasants he encouraged the nobility to swiftly and violently eliminate the rebelling peasants, stating,""[the peasants] must be sliced, choked, stabbed, secretly and publicly, by those who can, like one must kill a rabid dog.""",2023-06-25 14:25:15+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/29250,,,701,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Judging by these reports, along with the interest shown by the U.S. military in the symptoms of AIDS and the rate and geography of its spread, the most likely assumption is that this most dangerous disease is the result of yet another Pentagon experiment with a new type of biological weapon. This is confirmed by the fact that the disease affected initially only certain groups of people: homosexuals, drug addicts, immigrants from Latin America. The American authorities immediately blamed Haitian immigrants that they were the ones who had brought AIDS to the USA and announced that AIDS is not dangerous for the ""normal"" part of the population. However, during the following two years, it was revealed that AIDS can be transmitted through saliva and tears, and it turned out that even children are susceptible to this disease. An indirect indicator of the Pentagon’s involvement in the work with the AIDS virus is that it has been namely the military that has achieved the most significant results in the fight against the disease. Military medical centers in the USA, including the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) in Fort Detrick, Maryland, have developed in the strictest secrecy quite effective methods for the early detection of the disease, its treatment at this stage, and appropriate medications.""

Tognina's father, Petrus Gonsalvus, was born in Tenerife in 1556. He arrived as a child at the court of Henry II, where he was first kept as a monkey in the house and only paid attention to the adolescent. Peter, who is said to have spoken Latin, was joined by a wife who had no abnormal body hair. The couple had several children, some of whom, including Antonia, had inherited their father's illness. Henry made part of the park of Fontainebleau available to the family with the intention of providing a natural environment and shelter for his subjects. The ""monkey people"" regularly attended social events, dressed in courtly garb, little Tognina always outfitted like a doll. Around 1580/90 the Gonsalvus family may have traveled to Italy; their stay at the court of Margaret of Parma is mentioned.

This makes it harder for viruses to reproduce inside the mosquitoes. And the mosquitoes are much less likely to spread viruses from person to person. This means that when Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carry natural Wolbachia bacteria, the transmission of viruses like dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever is reduced. So, at the World Mosquito Program, we breed Wolbachia mosquitoes. Then, in partnership with local communities, we release them into areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases.",2023-06-16 17:28:36+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/28758,,,583,1,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaWebPage,1,https://www.worldmosquitoprogram.org/,worldmosquitoprogram.org,Home,"Join the World Mosquito Program in fighting dengue with our Wolbachia method, protecting communities worldwide from mosquito-borne diseases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Occasionally, after kissing the hand, the greeter will draw the hand to his own forehead. In the Philippines, the gesture evolved into just touching the hand to the forehead; hand-kissing itself has become a separate kind of gesture that has merged with the European custom concerning when it may be used. In Southern Italy, especially Sicily, the verbal greeting ""I kiss the hands."" (Italian: ""Bacio le mani."") derives from this usage. Similarly, in Hungary the verbal greeting ""I kiss your hand"" is sometimes used, especially when greeting elders and in rural communities. The shortened version ""I kiss it"" is more wide spread. In Romania the gesture is reserved for priests and women and it is common greeting when first introduced to a woman in parts of the country. The verbal expression towards women is ""I kiss your hand"". Towards priests it is sometimes changed into ""i kiss your right"" due to the belief that the right hand of the priest is holy and blessed regardless of the priest himself and any eventual shortcomings. In the past both parents used to get their hand kissed and seen as a type of blessing, however the expression is now almost exclusively towards women. The hand-kiss is used quite prominently in The Godfather series, as a way to indicate the person who is the Don. It also features in period films, such as Dangerous Liaisons.",2023-06-15 14:09:56+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/28682,,,581,0,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nigro Sansonese (1994), using the mythography supplied by Mylonas, hypothesizes that the Mysteries of Eleusis were a series of practical initiations into trance involving proprioception of the human nervous system induced by breath control (similar to samyama in yoga). Sansonese speculates that the kisté, a box holding sacred objects opened by the hierophant, is actually an esoteric reference to the initiate's skull, within which is seen a sacred light and are heard sacred sounds, but only after instruction in trance practice. Similarly, the seed-filled chambers of a pomegranate, a fruit associated with the founding of the cult, esoterically describe proprioception of the initiate's heart during trance.",2023-06-14 13:51:48+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/28646,,,576,2,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In late Renaissance European iconography, the Eye, surrounded by a triangle, was an explicit symbol of the Christian Holy Trinity.The Eye of Providence was later painted above an image of three faces in Pontormo's 1525 Supper at Emmaus. Seventeenth-century depictions of the Eye sometimes show it surrounded by clouds or sunbursts. The Eye of God in a triangle is still used in church architecture and Christian art to symbolize the Trinity and God's omnipresence and divine providence. The Eye of Providence is notably featured on the following Eastern Orthodox, Latter-day Saint, and Catholic buildings, among others: •The Kazan Cathedral, Saint Petersburg, Russia •The Salt Lake Temple, Salt Lake City, Utah •Jesuit Church, Mannheim, Germany •Shio-Mgvime Monastery, Mtskheta, Georgia",2023-06-13 16:18:31+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/28570,,,585,0,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msg_iteration.30910.user.Davidscave.post.28569,1620420179,Davidscave,28569,,"The circle is a symbol of wholeness and perfection. It is the container, the safe environment: the vessel in alchemy, the temenos in Greek religion, the place where healing can occur, the place of potential. With a few sure strokes of his brush, the eighteenth-century Japanese Zen master Torei creates a swirling, energy-charged circle. On one level, the circle represents the totality of the universe; on another it signifies its ultimate emptiness. Simultaneously a hole and a whole, the circle is the Nothing that contains the potential existence of Everything. From earliest time, Man represented the sun and the moon as circles, and in various ways paid homage to these heavenly bodies. Moreover, the movements of these and other heavily bodies were perceived as circular, whereas in fact their pattern is elliptical. Man’s sense of time -- and of his own mortality and of eternity -- derived from pondering the movements and alterations of these pilgrimaging orbs of light. From as early as 5000 BCE, the Neolithic cultures of western Europe expended a prodigious amount of labor in constructing giant circular burial monuments. The most famous of these is, of course, Stonehenge, which was built atop a man-made circular mound nearly 100 meters in diameter. Cremated human bones were found in many of the holes that formed two concentric circles inside the two-meter-high mound. For the dead, then, the circle was seen as a magically protective ring, perhaps providing assurance of an afterlife. Early dwellings in many places -- whether built of stone, wood, mud, hides, or reeds -- were circular. Some of the world’s greatest temples and churches are circular or, like the Pantheon or St. Peter’s in Rome, topped by a circular dome that represents heaven. The Indian god Brahma, as well the historical Buddha, is traditionally shown seated in meditation upon a circular lotus, and the circle forms the center of the mandalas drawn by Tibetan monks for use in meditation. The mandala, which combines the square and the circle, symbolizes wholeness -- or, in psychological terms, the totality of the psyche in all its aspects, including the relationship between man and the whole of nature. (Man and His Symbols, p. 240) The circle has always been a feminine sign--round hearths and houses were characteristic of early matriarchal cultures--and it also evokes equality. The knights of King Arthur’s Round Table “were seated in a circle to eliminate the sense of hierarchy among their brotherhood.” (The Woman’s Dictionary of Symbols & Sacred Objects, p. 4) Source: ARAS Archive for Research in Archetypal Symbolism",2023-06-13 16:18:19+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/28569,,,570,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some closed-beds were built one above the other in a double-decker, two-story arrangement. In this case, young people would sleep above. It was the main furniture of rural houses in Brittany until the 20th century. Often carved and decorated, it was the pride of its owners. Closed-beds were 1.60 to 1.70 m length, long enough for people of that region who were rather small. And because they slept in an almost sitting position, they leaned on three or four pillows. It was the tradition of the Middle Ages not to sleep lying down, because that is the position of the dead and of effigies Box-beds were also used to protect people of the home from the animals (pigs, hens) also living in the house.

Also known for his session guitar work, he has played with some of the most well-known artists and groups. Born in Scotland, he watched the subtleties of politics and media as these were used to guide the population of the U.K. covertly into a European amalgamation. He has been warning the North American peoples for some years now that the same process of amalgamation is being carried out in this area of the world: to integrate Canada, the USA and Mexico into a single trading bloc, and then into a political union. With historical documentation, he shows how cultures are created, altered and engineered by those in control, always to lead the people like sheep into the next pasture. His books are masterly works, designed to stimulate the mind so as to deprogram the reader from social indoctrination, and allow him or her to wake up: to start thinking for him or herself, and to start critically analyzing and studying the reality of the world (and existence) so as to personally discover them for what they truly are, while developing self-determination and individuality.

Hof, Regierung und Politik, Böhlau, 1997) writes that it would be unfair to say that Maximilan stood on the shoulders of a giant, yet nevertheless Frederick provided the shoulders without which Maximilian could not have become a giant himself. Frederick was a great benefactor to the Jews – his enemies described him as ""more of a Jew than a Holy Roman Emperor"". He favoured such Jewish scholars like Jacob ben Jehiel Loans, who was the teacher of the Hebraist Johann Reuchlin. His empress Eleanor also favoured Jews. For unknown reasons, their son Maximilian developed a dislike for the Jews as a child though, to the horror of both parents. His own relationship with the Jews evolved over the years though.

In 1984, forensic anthropologist Owen Beattie conducted an exhumation of Torrington's remains to investigate the cause of his demise.

According to Bede’s De Temporum Ratione and Charlemagne’s Julian Calendar, Ēosturmōnaþ, or Ostarmanoth, would be April, when much of Scandinavia would still be getting significant frost. It’s likely that Sigrblót would have been held on the April full moon. Despite the frost, the days would be getting visibly longer in Scandinavia, which marked the traditional beginning of Sumarr. ᛋ Painting: Ostara by Johannes Gehrts, 1884",2023-06-02 18:32:05+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/27885,,,543,0,1,1,PeerChannel,1847315346.0,sagnamadr,2023-04-05 17:45:06,2023-04-05,https://t.me/sagnamadr/228,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The act demonstrated the special connection that exists between socialist countries, consisting of an embrace, along with a series of three kisses on alternate cheeks. In rare cases, when the two leaders considered themselves exceptionally close, the kisses were given on the mouth rather than on the cheeks. After the Sino-Soviet split, the Chinese refused to embrace their Soviet counterparts or to address them as ""comrade"". When Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev tried to embrace Chinese Communist Party chairman Mao Zedong on a visit to Beijing in 1959, Mao stepped back to avoid the embrace and offered a handshake instead. Even with the normalization of relations in 1989, the Chinese continued to omit the fraternal embrace when greeting Soviet leaders.This was done to emphasize that Sino-Soviet relations were not returning to the pre-split level of the 1950s; Chinese protocol specifically insisted on ""handshake, no embrace.",2023-06-01 23:36:09+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/27848,,,606,0,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was able to find a way to preserve the skin containing the tattoo, and he began collecting specimens for research by placing them in glass frames. The doctor also took an interest in the fates of tattooed people, sometimes helping financially those unfortunate people for whom times were difficult.

Such knowledge is understood as the means of ""return'' and ''reunion'' of the human soul with the Godhead.

In popular media the ""butterfly effect"" stems from the real-world implications of the Lorenz attractor, namely that several different initial chaotic conditions evolve in phase space in a way that never repeats, so all chaos is unpredictable. This underscores that chaotic systems can be completely deterministic and yet still be inherently unpredictable over long periods of time. Because chaos continually increases in systems, we cannot predict the future of systems well.

Others claim he was either a student of Pittacus, the teacher of Pythagoras, or a well-traveled autodidact who had studied secret Phoenician books. A comparatively large number of sources say Pherecydes was the first to teach the Pythagorean doctrine of metempsychosis, the transmigration of human souls.

FILM DESCRIPTION: Viggo Mortensen, Naomi Watts, Armin Mueller-Stahl, and Vincent Cassel star in this David Cronenberg's thriller concerning a London midwife who unwittingly stumbles into a clandestine Russian sex trafficking ring. An unidentified Russian teen has been rushed to a London hospital after going into labor. Though midwife Anna Khitrova (Watts) does manage to deliver a healthy baby girl, the newborn's mother dies tragically during delivery. But the deceased mother's secrets did not die with her, because she has left behind a diary. Determined to ensure the newborn is placed with her rightful family, Anna attempts to read the diary and discovers a business card for a local restaurant therein. Upon visiting the restaurant Anna is greeted by kindly owner Semyon (Mueller-Stahl), who generously offers to translate it for her. But Semyon is not what he appears to be, and before long Anna begins to fear that the child could be in great danger. Semyon admits to Anna that the diary contains information about his son Kirill (Cassell) that could land the volatile offspring in jail despite the fact that Kirill is at heart a good person. As the truth begins to unfold and Anna begins to believe that Kirill and his driver Nikolai (Mortensen) - an ambitious driver seeking to ascent the ranks of the notorious Russian mafia - mean the baby harm, an underworld storm begins to brew that could consume all involved.

This find caused a wide public outcry because of the fossilized microscopic structures found on the surface of the meteorite, which could be bacteria. The question of an extraterrestrial origin of bacteria is still open, but it is supported by the fact that the size of the found structures is 20-100 nanometers in diameter, which is much smaller than any known form of cellular life.

Who are the Denisovans? Are they the true founders of human civilization? Are they the giants of legend? Evidence of the emergence of high culture in the form of musical instruments, advanced stone tool technologies, bone needles, precision finished jewellery, advanced calendrical systems, swan shamanism, and even horse domestication has been linked to an extinct human population recently discovered in southern Siberia. Known today as the Denisovans, there is every indication that 60,000-70,000 years ago they were the most advanced human species on the planet. Legends from southern Siberia regarding this population suggest that they were the first to built bridges, irrigation channels, and even megalithic monuments. By way of an introduction to his new book The Cygnus Key, Andrew Collins reveals the true impact of the Denisovans on everything from Gobekli Tepe to the birth of Egypt’s Pyramid Age, and the spread worldwide of a calendrical system based on eclipse cycles that was almost certainly invented by the Denisovans. He will also show the Denisovans profound knowledge of sound and sound acoustics that eventually finds expression in the construction of the earliest and most accomplished enclosures at Göbekli Tepe. Andrew Collins was born on January 25, 1957, in Bedford, England. He is a science and history writer, and the author of books that challenge the way we perceive the past. They include From the Ashes of Angels, Gods of Eden, Gateway to Atlantis, Tutankhuman: The Exodus Conspiracy (co-authored with Chris Ogilvie Herald), The Cygnus Mystery, Göbekli Tepe: Genesis of the Gods and The Cygnus Key: The Denisovan Legacy, Göbekli Tepe and the Birth of Egypt. He lives in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. He spoke at Megalithomania in 2006, 2010 and 2013 and is co-founder of the Origins Conference in London with Hugh Newman. http://www.andrewcollins.com Filmed at the Megalithomania Conference in May 2018 in Glastonbury.

They knew the elements and their properties, but they abused their knowledge, applied it where they ought not. They exterminated one another in wars. The present nations do the same. This is the reason the ancient nations perished, and their power and knowledge was taken from them. If the current nations also follow their path, they too will disappear. If the European nations do not come to their senses, the same fate that befell Nineveh awaits them. Whoever transgresses God's will loses His blessing.

In its most general formulation, morphic resonance means that the so-called laws of nature are more like habits. The hypothesis of morphic resonance also leads to a radically new interpretation of memory storage in the brain and of biological inheritance. Memory need not be stored in material traces inside brains, which are more like TV receivers than video recorders, tuning into influences from the past.

Subscribe Morphic resonance is a process whereby self-organising systems inherit a memory from previous similar systems. In its most general formulation, morphic resonance means that the so-called laws of nature are more like habits. The hypothesis of morphic resonance also leads to a radically new interpretation of memory storage in the brain and of biological inheritance. Memory need not be stored in material traces inside brains, which are more like TV receivers than video recorders, tuning into influences from the past. And biological inheritance need not all be coded in the genes, or in epigenetic modifications of the genes; much of it depends on morphic resonance from previous members of the species.

The Emperor Shun, Shu King, would travel each year throughout the provinces to check on the health and status of each territory. He would not audit books, observe the population, or interview authorities as the most important means to assess the health of his empire. Instead, the Emperor tested the exact pitches of their notes of music, the five notes of the ancient Chinese tonal scale. Eight types of instruments were brought and local songs played so that he could verify that they were all in line with the 5 tones. To the ancient Chinese, music was the basis of not only civilization, but of everything. The nature of the music reflected the nature of the people and Emperor Shun would use it to determine their health. https://www.shockwave-sound.com/blog/the-secret-power-of-music-the-ancients-part-1/",2023-05-27 13:16:16+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/27424,,,544,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke both quote Jesus using the word in a phrase often rendered in English as ""You cannot serve both God and mammon."" In the Middle Ages, it was often personified and sometimes included in the seven princes of Hell. Mammon in Hebrew (ממון) means ""money"". The word was adopted to modern Hebrew to mean wealth. The spelling μαμμωνᾷ refers to ""a Syrian deity, god of riches; Hence riches, wealth""; μαμωνᾶς is transliterated from Aramaic [ממון] and also means ""wealth"". Christians began to use ""mammon"" as a pejorative, a term that was used to describe gluttony, excessive materialism, greed, and unjust worldly gain.",2023-05-26 11:54:36+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/27353,,,561,1,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To raise a child is to teach him the fundamental issues that will make him someone who knows how to judge wisely, someone healthy, prudent and virtuous, and that will keep him away from stubbornness and conceitedness that so often are confused for true wisdom.",2023-05-26 01:29:58+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/27323,,,625,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unable to disengage the afterburner, Holden ran down the runway, narrowly missing a crossing fuel bowser and a de Havilland Comet taking off, before taking off himself. Flying without a helmet or canopy, the ejection seat disabled, and the landing gear locked down, Holden aborted his first two landing attempts. He landed on his third approach, striking the runway with the aircraft's tail as he adopted in his landing technique of a taildragger aircraft. The aircraft returned to service, and was subsequently acquired by the Imperial War Museum Duxford. https://sierrahotel.net/blogs/news/holdens-lightning-flight",2023-05-25 16:51:18+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/27298,,,4640,0,21,0,,,,,,,1,27297.0,https://t.me/Davidscave/27297,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sapphires on the staff (called “Sephirot” on the Tree of Life) are said to contain all of the mystical teaching, showing us how to awaken our true humanity, live consciously and connect with the Divine. So when Adam and Eve ventured forth from the garden, they carried with them a complete representation of the Tree of Life in the form of a staff, providing them with all they needed to grow, thrive and have a meaningful life. The Sapphire Staff was then passed down through the generations as a staff of knowledge, from Abraham to Isaac to Jacob and then to Joseph, who had become one of top advisors to the Egyptian Pharaoh.

This semantic shift is deeply significant, for it implies that dissatisfaction with life is itself pathological, a medical condition, which it is the responsibility of the doctor to alleviate by medical means. Everyone has a right to health; depression is unhealthy; therefore everyone has a right to be happy (the opposite of being depressed). This idea in turn implies that one’s state of mind, or one’s mood, is or should be independent of the way that one lives one’s life, a belief that must deprive human existence of all meaning, radically disconnecting reward from conduct. A ridiculous pas de deux between doctor and patient ensues: the patient pretends to be ill, and the doctor pretends to cure him.

By recording the slightest movements of laser light or magnets, these devices can detect the smallest of rumbles even when we can't sense them. There are networks of thousands upon thousands of seismographs set up across the globe that can accurately determine the epicenter of an earthquake -- its point of origin. And with all the data these clusters produce, we are constantly improving our understanding of these geological events, developing early warning systems and figuring out how to build the safest structures. We have technology on our side, of course, and yet the design of the earliest earthquake detection device isn't that different from today's versions. Only it was created nearly 2000 years ago, before people even understood what an earthquake was.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His chief work, “Saggio teoretico di diritto naturale appogiato sul fatto”, i. e. “A Theoretical Essay on Natural Right from an Historical Standpoint” (2 vols., 7th ed., Rome, 1883), was in a way the beginning of modern sociology. It was translated into German (Ratisbon, 1845) and twice into French (Tournai, 1851; Paris, 1896). Herein was developed the position, at once widely accepted in conservative circles on the Continent, that the normal origin of civil government was by extension of paternal power through the patriarchal head of a group of families.",2023-05-21 12:49:59+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/27048,,,543,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's taken me a long time to finish this because I have tried to understand why people dislike the idea that everything is predetermined so much. I hope that in this video I have addressed the biggest misconceptions. I genuinely think that discarding superdeterminism unthinkingly is the major reason that research in the foundations of physics is stuck.

He was in the employ of the Dutch West India Company and produced maps for over 30 years for use by Dutch mercantile and military shipping. He was a business partner of Joan Blaeu, one of the most important map and atlas publishers of the day. Vinckeboons drew a series of 200 manuscript maps that were used in the production of atlases, including Blaeu's Atlas Major. This map from around 1650 shows California as an island. A half-century would pass before Spanish explorers determined with certainty that California was connected to the mainland of North America.",2023-05-17 19:27:02+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/26811,,,464,0,7,1,PeerChannel,1497242922.0,vaultofsecrets,2023-05-17 19:26:23,2023-05-17,https://t.me/vaultofsecrets/12529,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This post has been shared on all social media sites. John Mwangi, a pastor from Githurai, says he is holy and close to God. Because he's holy and close to God, he says, he can't walk on sinful ground. So this pastor's followers carry him on a chair like an old king or lord. People are worried about this because he seems to be more holy than Jesus, who is the Son of God, even though Jesus never asked his disciples to carry him. Some people say that this is the end of the world, just as the prophets said it would be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This Bulgarian tradition has been practiced since Thracian times and is of a Thracian origin. The custom is generally thought to be related to the Thracian Dionysos cult in the wider area of Thracia and similar rituals can also be found in much of the Balkans. The term could be derived from Proto-Slavic *kuka (""evil spirit"") with the agentive suffix *-ařь (i.e. literally meaning a ""chaser of evil spirits""), or from a pre-Slavic divinity named Kuk. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kukeri",2023-05-17 12:52:23+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/26766,,,576,1,8,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tylis was founded in 277 B.C. by Gallic conquerors led by a chieftain named Comontorios. The kingdom grew wealthy through controlling trade and collecting protection money from Greek colonies in the area, notable among them Byzantium (now Istanbul, Turkey). Tragically, the kingdom of Tylis lasted a mere 60 years, being first weakened by corruption, then destroyed by a combination of internal rebellions and attacks by the native Thracian population. To this day, archaeologists have never successfully located the lost city of Tylis. The most likely candidate for identification with the city of Tylis is the (still) un-excavated hill-fort of Arkovna, located in the Varna region of Bulgaria.

The Billiken, as a good luck charm, appears multiple times in the Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor movie Waterloo Bridge. It is employed as a device that both prompts recollections of the male lead, Robert Taylor, and that links several scenes within the movie as the plot unfolds. Wizard of Oz author L.

The bat (also called the reremouse, reermouse, or rearmouse) is a heraldic symbol sometimes used as a charge, but most prominently used as a crest on or around the crown in municipal arms of the former Crown of Aragon—specifically in Valencia, Catalonia and the Balearic Islands. The heraldic use of the bat has its origins in the ""royal dragon"" crest (cimera reial) of the coat of arms of the Kings of Aragon. The royal helmet has a víbria, a traditional Catalan dragon, emerging from a crown as its crest. Although traditionally the dragon helmet is ascribed to king James I of Aragon (1208 – 1276), reliable documents state that the winged dragon didn't appear over the helmet until Peter IV of Aragon's reign (1319 – 1387).

Due to improper management and illegal procedures, a criticality event occurred that severely irradiated three technicians: Hisashi Ouchi, Masato Shinohara, and Yutaka Yokokawa. As a level 4 nuclear accident, it could have been worse, but some radiation did escape to the surrounding area. Fortunately, no ill effects to the town or citizens is known to have occurred beyond an inconvenient evacuation and stay-inside order. But as for two of the three employees, Ouchi and Shinohara, they're fate would not be nearly as pleasant. Hisashi Ouchi is often incorrectly attributed as the ""most radiative man ever."" This isn't true at all, nor are the rumors that doctors only kept him alive as an observation subject. It's all made up for click-bait, so be cautious of who you hear this story from. 0:00 - Intro 1:24 - The Power 3:03 - 1997 Accident 5:43 - Radiation 7:24 - 1999 Accident 17:22 - Victims 22:47 - Aftermath ""There have been two noteworthy nuclear accidents at the Tōkai village nuclear campus, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. The first accident occurred on 11 March 1997, producing an explosion after an experimental batch of solidified nuclear waste caught fire at the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNC) radioactive waste bituminisation facility. Over twenty people were exposed to radiation. The second was a criticality accident at a separate fuel reprocessing facility belonging to Japan Nuclear Fuel Conversion Co. (JCO) on 30 September 1999 due to improper handling of liquid uranium fuel. The incident spanned approximately 20 hours and resulted in radiation exposure for 667 people and the death of two workers."" ☢️ Further reading ☢️ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokaimura_nuclear_accidents 🟢Join this channel to get access to perks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsmGCJdCZeKxrbqs_l4YCQA/join 🟢Patreon - https://www.patreon.com/Darknessthecurse 🟣Discord - https://discord.gg/KEX5eeRcxF 🔵Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/History-in-the-Dark-109003305113711 🟢Donations - https://streamlabs.com/edgerabbit/tip 🔴Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryintheDark/ 🔴Tiktok - https://www.tiktok.com/@historyinthedark 🟣Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/historyinthedark/ 🔵Twitter - http://www.twitter.com/DarktheCurse 🟣Merch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsmGCJdCZeKxrbqs_l4YCQA/store 🟣Twitch - http://www.twitch.tv/edgerabbit Other channels: 🟢Prehistory in the Dark: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsbkaWQ4rUKMedsE0VCdzrg 🟣Gaming and Fanfic Readings: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCig-6ZTjigUQBIi3O4XSdlw 🟣Stream Highlights: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtR7Z-lC2PlDNaNvrcDo8PQ 🟣History Stuff: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsmGCJdCZeKxrbqs_l4YCQA 👔Merch: https://streamlabs.com/edgerabbit/merch --- I WRITE BOOKS!

The months that followed the accident were a living nightmare for him. On the 45th day, the skin was completely stripped from Ouchi's flesh, after which his internal organs began to rapidly deteriorate. On the 59th day his heart failed three times in a row, but doctors managed to pump it out. It was reported that during his treatment, Hisashi asked several times to be relieved of his unbearable pain, and once he even said he didn't want to be a guinea pig anymore! However, Ouchi's torment continued until the 83rd day, which brought him his long-awaited deliverance.

Other capitals in the abbey church portray the theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity, and the four rivers of paradise. This provided the monks with a perpetual visual/architectural meditation on both the virtues to which they aspired and the musical modes (analogous to modern key signatures) they regarded as the basis of the Gregorian Chant that consecrated the hours of the Benedictine-monastic day. One recent author has noted: [In the Cod. Basiliensis (ca. 1310)] the authentic modes are correlated with the four temperaments: sanguis, cholera, phlegma, melancholia; the four plagal modes, with four virtues: justitia, temperantia, prudentia, and fortitudo.

As the story goes, one of the winery workers had a soft spot for the often unwelcome cellar guests. He found it unfair that he could drink all the sherry he wanted while the mice could not. To rectify this, he built a little ladder leading up to a glass full of sherry. This way the mice could have their fill without him having to share his drink with the rodents. A second, not as fun story suggests the sherry was placed out for the mice to keep them from nibbling away at the Solera (on-the-ground) casks that are kept in the bodega, the area where the alcohol is aged and stored. The tradition continues and everyday a small glass of sherry is placed on the floor. A tiny ladder lets the mice access their boozy treat. People, too, have been enjoying the local sherry for years. The history of winemaking in the Iberian peninsula dates back to the Phoenicians. Jerez de la Frontera, a small Spanish city steeped in sherry culture, plays host to some of the most prominent sherry-making bodegas in the world.

From his father, Raphael learned painting; in his native Urbino, he experienced intellectual court life. A year after his father's sudden death, Raphael entered the workshop of Urbino's leading painter at age twelve and quickly surpassed his master. By the age of twenty-one, Raphael had moved to Florence, where he embraced the works of Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. In Florence, his many paintings of the Madonna and Child display his characteristic human warmth, serenity, and sublimely perfect figures. Raphael's art epitomized the High Renaissance qualities of harmony and ideal beauty. In four years Raphael's fame led to a summons to Rome from Pope Julius II. As painter to the papal court, his work met with high praise, and he established himself as the most favored artist in Rome. He was commissioned to paint portraits, devotional subjects, and the Pope's private rooms; he also designed tapestries. Raphael was soon placed in charge of all papal projects involving architecture, paintings, decoration, and the preservation of antiquities. His untimely death at the age of thirty-seven, Vasari said, ""plunged into grief the entire papal court""; the Pope, who ""wept bitterly when he died, had intended making him a Cardinal.""

How the fate of a man with an IQ below 50 unfolded Good-natured Joe Arridi, with an IQ of 46, was wrongly accused of killing a 15-year-old girl and sentenced to death.

msg_iteration.33264.user.Davidscave.post.26171,1620420179,Davidscave,26171,,"Tinku The Bolivian tradition began with the indigenous belief in Pachamama, or Mother Nature. The combat is in praise of Pachamama, and any blood shed throughout the fighting is considered a sacrifice, in hopes of a fruitful harvest and fertility. Because of the violent nature of the tradition there have been fatalities, but each death is considered a sacrifice which brings forth life, and a donation to the land that fertilizes it. The brawls are also considered a mean of release of frustration and anger between the separate communities. Tinkus usually last two to three days. Tinku, which means something like “violent encounter” in Aymara, is the most notorious element of certain festivals celebrated by two native groups in the Andes, specifically the Aymara and the Quechua. In addition to the brawling, the festivals also include feasts, elaborate dances and huge, choreographed musical events. Some of the biggest are held in the towns of Macha and Potosi.",2023-05-08 21:57:51+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/26171,,,651,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,video/mp4,5.10052353231238e+18,37.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Attacks on Aristotle were often launched by those who emphasized the fact that he had not been a Christian; some fanatics even thought that his philosophy had paved the way for Satan. Ramus did not share this view. According to him, it was not because Aristotle had been a pagan that he was wrong but rather because he had been misinterpreted by later commentators. He considered Aristotle to be the most important of logicians, though he pointed out that Aristotle had not invented the discipline of logic but rather developed what his predecessors had hinted at. Even more significant for Ramus was the need to call attention to the damage that the corpus Aristotelicum had suffered after Aristotle’s death, which meant that we could not know for certain what he had intended to say on any given question. Because of the bad state in which Aristotle’s texts were transmitted, his commentators, in their discussions of individual books of the Metaphysics and Physics, had taken up certain issues that really belonged to logic.

A Protestant convert, he was a victim of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. Born into a family that had lost its wealth but not its title of nobility with the sack of Liège in 1468, Ramus was the son of Jacques de La Ramée, a laborer, and Jeanne Charpentier. After a primary education at home, in 1527 he entered the University of Paris (Collège de Navarre), where he met his costs by working as a manservant. Apparently an outstanding student, he first drew widespread attention in 1536 with his defense of an M.A. thesis, “Quaecumque ab Aristotele dicta essent, commentitia esse,” in which he attacked not only the accuracy but also the authenticity of traditional Aristotelian philosophy. Ramism, while in fashion, met with considerable hostility. The Jesuits were completely opposed.

In Julian Jaynes' book, The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, he suggests that consciousness arose rather recently in human history, sometime between the composition of The Iliad and The Odyssey. Although Jaynes' work as a theory of consciousness has achieved a great deal of attention (and indeed criticism), what has not been widely noted is the prominent role of volition in his theory. In this article I hope to draw attention to these overlooked aspects of his theory, in particular the fact that volition is central to Jaynes' definition of consciousness and that it is changes in the nature of volitional experience that mark, for Jaynes, the emergence of consciousness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.33345.user.Davidscave.post.26088,1620420179,Davidscave,26088,,"Willy Verginer’s Ingenious Wood Sculptures Artwork Willy Verginer is an Italian woodcarver artist who creates realistic, figurative wooden sculptures of people. His figurative wooden sculptures are carved from solid pieces of lindenwood and often painted with acrylic or accompanied by additional materials. As for the technique there are not many differences between Willy Verginer and a woodcarver of Italian medieval period. The element that makes his wooden creations up to date and his style unique, is undoubtedly the color and the manner that he choose to apply it. His wooden sculptures are painted with bright colors, immersed or half-immersed in it, ornamented with colorful patterns or even accessories. Appearing simultaneously lifelike and whimsical, the wooden sculptures are dipped in bold colors and patterned, adding just the right amount of surrealism. In his “Cecità Voluta,” characters sprawl on a dock, their legs disappearing into the ground, as bright orange paints trick the eye into seeing varying levels of immersion in the “water.” Willy Verginer was born in 1957. He lives and works in a small town called Ortisei in South Tyrol, Italy. His work has found international support and has been exhibited in galleries around the world.

But a bigger challenge as the program moves forward is whether the program can prevail in the yearly Defense Department battles over funding, keep its costs down and deliver the 100 aircraft the Air Force says it needs to maintain its edge over adversaries. Air Force and Northrop Grumman officials at the B-21 roll-out ceremony in Palmdale, California, gave an upbeat assessment of not only the program’s current costs, but how much funding it will require in the future. Andrew Hunter, Air Force undersecretary for acquisition, technology and logistics, told reporters that so far, the program is “tracking well” on cost and schedule. “One of the key aspects of this program is that we had a very firm cost target. That is a requirement for the program. And that will support our ability to deliver the number of aircraft we need to truly perform…",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But take out that one offending preposition and it's true — quokkas sacrifice their babies in order to escape predators. ""The pouch is really muscular so the mum will relax it and the bub will fall out,"" conservation biologist Matthew Hayward from the University of Newcastle says. ""The youngsters flail around on the ground and hiss and make noise and the mum gets away."" It's the ""ultimate survival strategy"" that's only really available to marsupials, according to kangaroo ecologist and behavioural expert Graeme Coulson from the University of Melbourne. ""[The mother is] interested in her own survival and her future reproduction,"" Associate Professor Coulson said. But before you judge quokkas too harshly, you should know they're not alone in employing this dastardly device, according to Professor Hayward. ""Macropods in general, that's their strategy to get away from predators,"" he said.

You can spend eternities reinforcing with like-minded people in echo chambers that the world is bad. Even after the millionth protest enlightenment infowarrior posting, nothing has gotten better. Going out on the street, shouting loudly and waving colorful banners and declaring that you are AGAINST something doesn't change anything either. You only reach those who resonate on your frequency anyway. And they are just as convinced as you that it is the corrupt politicians, the dark despots, the Illuminati, the aliens, the lizard people, Bill Gates & Co who are to blame for all evil. That's why they are, just like you, AGAINST. Encouragement from own ranks is nothing but echo, but in no case profit. You turn thus in the circle. It is great if one recognizes that something is rotten. However, you have not understood that what you oppose, you only reinforce. By putting your focus on what you don't want, you create what you don't want. Energy follows attention. This is a universal law. (Which, by the way, also works with your personal problems!) If you've been a spiritual teenager long enough (some are for a lifetime) and come to maturity, you will have understood that the only way to make the world a better place is to make yourself a better place. To do this, you must confront the sinister despot, conspirator, monsters and lizard people (the Bill Gates) within you. That's where the devils and demons haunt, which you should learn to ride instead of shadow-boxing yourself on the outside. The world changes only by changing the individual. Each of us is a cell in the body of the greater whole. No body heals by one cell attesting malice to another, but only by each individual cell healing from the core. Or more simply: The whole is only as sick or healthy as the sum of its parts. This too is universal.

msg_iteration.33558.user.Davidscave.post.25871,1620420179,Davidscave,25871,,"Before the printing press made books cheap and easily available, books in the Middle Ages were incredibly scarce and precious. Without a method to mass produce, each book had to carefully copied by hand that took thousands of hours of skilled work. During the later middle ages, when publicly accessible libraries came into being, books were often chained to the shelves allowing the public to read, while at the same time safe-guarding the library’s valuable collection from potential thieves. The chains were fitted to the corner or cover of the books via ringlets, and were long enough to allow the books to be taken from their shelves and read, but not removed from the library itself. Only the librarian could remove the books from the chain using a key. The books were typically shelved with their foredges facing the reader, rather than their spines. This may seem like the wrong way, but it did allow the books to be lifted down and opened without needing to be turned around, thus avoiding tangling the chain. With the introduction of the printing press, duplicates became more readily available and the value of books dropped significantly. By the late 1800s, the practice of chaining books to the shelves died out. Today only a handful of chained libraries exist, solely for the sake of preservation.

The Bateses retired to Seville, Ohio, where they built a mansion with high ceilings and doorframes. Bates conceived two children with Martin.

msg_iteration.33592.user.Davidscave.post.25837,1620420179,Davidscave,25837,,"There’s a story told by the historian Diogenes Laertius of the ancient Greek philosopher Pyrrho’s amazing ability to remain calm, even when in great danger. The philosopher was travelling on a ship when a storm struck. His fellow passengers were terrified that the ship might wreck in the storm as it was tossed about by enormous waves. Pyrrho, however, remained “calm and serene and, pointing to a little pig on the ship that was eating away, said that the wise man ought to repose in just such a state of freedom from disturbance.” The pig was in just as much danger as its fellow passengers, but ate in blissful ignorance. Pyrrho thought that a man would be wise to be as serene as the pig was, since everybody on board the ship had no more control over the situation than the pig had. The state of mind Pyrrho is referring to is “ataraxia”, a crucial concept to ancient philosophy that was somehow lost to the modern world. The word roughly translates to “unperturbed” (or literally: “without (mental) trouble”)",2023-05-05 01:18:46+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/25837,,,722,0,10,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I suffer from the delicacy of my feelings with comtemptuos attention. I have all the qualities for wich romantic poets are admired, even the lack of those same qualities for wich one is really a romantic poet. I find myself described (partially) in several romances as the protagonist of several plots; but the essential in my life, as of my soul, is never being a protagonist. I don't have an idea of myself; not even that one that consists in the lack of an idea of myself. I'm a nomad of my own consciousness. The flocks of my inner richness got lost at the first guard. The only tragedy is that we can't conceive ourselves as tragic. I always saw clearly my coexistence with the world. I never felt clearly my lack of coexistence with it; that's why I've never been normal. Doing is resting. Every problem is unsolvable. The very essence of a problem is its lacking of a solution. Looking for a fact means lacking the fact. Thinking is knowing not to exist. Sometimes I spend hours in the Terreiro do Paço, in the shore of the river, meditating in vain. My impatience constantly wants to steal this quietness, and my inertia constantly fixes me in it. Then I meditate in a physicall slackness that resembles the weak voluptuousness of the wind imitating voices, in the eternal insatisfaction of my vague desires, in the everlasting instability of my impossible craving. I suffer, mainly, from the sickness of being able to suffer. I lack everything that I don't want and then I suffer because that is not suffering. The boardwalk, the evening, the surge of the sea, they all enter together in the composition of my anguish. The flutes of the impossible shepherds aren't smoother than the lack of the flutes themselves and, because of that, minding them. The languid idylls at the shore of small rivers pain me this analoguos hour within...",2023-05-04 12:04:48+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/25786,,,907,0,4,0,,,,,,,1,25785.0,https://t.me/Davidscave/25785,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Frans Hals, 1599- 1660, was one of the most sought after portraitists in the Dutch baroque era. Although born in Antwerp, he lived and worked most of his life in Haarlem. Together with Rembrandt and Vermeer he is the most famous and influential painter from the 17th century in The Netherlands. Hals’ body of work consists mainly of portraits and a few genre scenes. He depicts a wide variety of sitters and patrons. From wealthy merchants and political figures to clergymen and large group portraits of regents and civic guards. Instead of using formal poses and serious expressions Hals preferred to capture his models being relaxed, spontaneous and even smiling. His portraits are easily recognized by their vivid brushwork, characterization of his models, his varied use of the color black and sense of joy in life and painting. Hals’ pictorial style proved a great inspiration for artists such as Manet, Sargent, Whistler and Van Gogh. The Merry Drinker is one of Hals’ most famous works.",2023-05-02 19:46:48+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/25683,,,515,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These discoveries could offer clues about biological mechanisms or, because children inherit genetics and social class from parents, education-linked genetics could be spurious correlates of socially transmitted advantages. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we studied social mobility in five cohorts from three countries. We found that people with more education-linked genetics were more successful compared with parents and siblings. We also found mothers’ education-linked genetics predicted their children’s attainment over and above the children’s own genetics, indicating an environmentally mediated genetic effect. Findings reject pure social-transmission explanations of education GWAS discoveries.

They are one of the best known classes of yōkai (monster-spirits), though this classification does not prevent their occasional worship as Shinto kami (revered spirits or gods). Although the term tengu was derived from the Chinese designation for a type of dog-like demons 天狗 (tian gou), the Japanese spirits were originally thought to take the forms of birds of prey, such that they are traditionally depicted with both human and avian characteristics. In the earliest sources, tengu were actually pictured with beaks, but, in later depictions, these features have often been anthropomorphized into unnaturally long noses. In the modern imagination (and especially in artistic works), this single characteristic (the expansive proboscis) is the most definitive aspect of the tengu.",2023-04-30 15:07:12+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/25513,,,570,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The circular shape is obtained by a booklet and fine bamboo frames linked internally by ties to the basket. The caulking is done with a decoction composed of pulverized resin, lime and buffalo dung, all then coated with wood oil to varnish and protect the caulking. Admirably adapted to always stay on the blades, the cross effect not existing, we encountered it, even in rough sea and strong swells, around fishing boats, to set or raise traps, longlines or gillnets. The origin of these coracles is unclear, but many believe they were born out of ingenuity during the French colonial era: when the French levied taxes on boats in Vietnam, fishermen couldn't afford to pay them, so they designed circular woven ""baskets"" that just so happened to also function as boats. The basket boats quickly became popular up and down the coast thanks to both their tax-free status and their impressive engineering.",2023-04-29 18:17:11+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/25450,,,565,1,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results obtained in the laboratories showed that the highest levels of mercury exposure to organisms were observed at the beginning of the Copper Age, between 2900 and 2600 B.C.

For many years, the towns of Buda, Óbuda, and Pest were separate and independent. In 1873, they were joined together and given the new name Budapest. The bronze and stone sculpture is meant to symbolize the unification of the city. The statue tells a beautiful but tragic tale of Prince Buda and Princess Pest, two lovers divided by the Danube. It depicts Prince Buda and Princess Pest reaching out to embrace over the river separating them, it represents the two halves of the city becoming unified. Buda is the hillier, greener and older side of the now joined city, while Pest was the flatter more dynamic side of the city. The sculpture by Martha Lesenyei was installed in 1982 and stands near the Garden of Philosophers.

By 1902 he had created a secret mixture of 23 chemicals in large galvanized evaporating tanks that, he claimed, attracted rain. Hatfield called himself a ""moisture accelerator"". In 1904, promoter Fred Binney began a public relations campaign for Hatfield. A number of Los Angeles ranchers saw his ads in newspapers and promised Hatfield $50 to produce rain. In February, Hatfield and his brother Paul built an evaporating tower at La Crescenta where Hatfield released his mixture into the air. Hatfield's attempt was apparently successful, so the ranchers paid him $100. Contemporary weather bureau reports described the rain as a small part of a storm that was already coming but Hatfield's supporters disregarded this. Hatfield began to receive more job offers. He promised Los Angeles 18 inches (46 cm) of rain, apparently succeeded, and collected a fee of $1000. For this effort, Hatfield had built his tower on the grounds of the Esperanza Sanitarium in Altadena, near Rubio Canyon. Charles Hatfield died January 12, 1958 and took his chemical formula with him to his grave in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.",2023-04-28 18:57:42+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/25352,,,519,2,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the early 1920s, however, the weakening of family ties, combined with the devastation and dislocation caused by the Russian Civil War (1918–21), resulted in nearly 7 million homeless children. This situation prompted senior Bolshevik Party officials to conclude that the State needed a more stable family life to rebuild the country's economy and shattered social structure. By 1922 the government allowed some forms of inheritance. Government agencies simply did not have the resources to care for the children. An adopted child could be cared for by a family at virtually no cost to the state. The 1926 code would reinstate adoption as a solution for child homelessness.",2023-04-27 19:35:35+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/25277,,,632,2,10,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Today we look at the changes that have taken place in the last six decades as China has gone through the Cultural Revolution and opened itself to the world. Maoist China to Modern day Mao saw the clan and the family as institutions that kept the peasants oppressed so he issued several policies to break down the family structure. Families were made to eat in cafeterias; which meant no home needed a kitchen, children were raised in daycare centers instead of being looked after by relatives, parents were cremated instead of buried, and the ancestor tablets (family records) and ancestral halls were destroyed in the Cultural Revolution. Mao’s attempts to remove the family from the center of Chinese life ultimately failed, but not before destroying a few aspects of traditional culture. When the ancestral temples were destroyed most families lost the records of their extended family. This has lead to a major shift in China, family is now seen as the 3 living generations, beyond that is largely forgotten. My friend is a devout communist and an ardent defender of the party (the one who wrote about joining the party), but the loss of his family’s history is one act that he has not forgiven Mao for. The temples have not been rebuilt, and most ancestor worship has disappeared. https://chinachange.org/2011/03/17/the-chinese-family-under-mao/",2023-04-27 19:35:26+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/25276,,,618,0,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaWebPage,1,https://chinachange.org/2011/03/17/the-chinese-family-under-mao/,chinachange.org,The Chinese Family Under Mao,Yesterday we looked at the traditional idea of family in China through most of its history.

He is the son of Louis VIII, known as ""the lion"", and Blanche of Castile, from whom he receives a strict and pious education throughout his life. Courageous and combative warrior, skilful and wise ruler, eager and faithful husband, deeply pious, the king appears as the model of the Christian knight, hence his canonization a few years after his death (1297). His long reign coincided with the apogee of medieval, Capetian and Christian France. He put an end to the first war against England (battle of Taillebourg) as well as to the Albigensian crusade. His reign began in a turbulent way with a revolt of lords, who wanted to take the place of the child. One can notably mention the lord Mauclerc. He was concerned with the extension of the royal domain. The latter will be strengthened by some territories including Carcassonne. He led a reign inspired by the values of Christianity which contributed to the idea that spiritual and political powers could be embodied by one man. He mitigated the excesses of feudalism in favor of the notion of the common good and developed royal justice, where the sovereign appeared as ""the supreme avenger"". In this way, he gradually transformed France from a feudal monarchy to a modern monarchy, no longer based solely on the personal relationship of the king with his vassals, but on that of the king as head of state with his ""subjects. Under his reign, Paris became the most prestigious city in the West with its University and its religious monuments (Sainte Chapelle, Notre-Dame). The Champagne fairs favored trade and allowed the birth of an active and enterprising urban bourgeoisie.",2023-04-25 19:20:17+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/25165,,,609,0,3,0,,,,,,,1,25164.0,https://t.me/Davidscave/25164,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(1297) Son long règne coïncide avec l'apogée de la France médiévale, capétienne et chrétienne. Il met fin à la première guerre contre l'Angleterre (bataille de Taillebourg) ainsi qu'à la croisade des Albigeois. Son règne commence de manière turbulente avec une révolte des seigneurs, qui souhaitent prendre la place de l'enfant. On peut notamment citer le seigneur Mauclerc. Il a le soucis de l'extension du domaine royal. Ce dernier se verra renforcé de quelques territoires notamment Carcassonne. Il mène un règne inspiré des valeurs du christianisme qui contribue à fonder l'idée que les pouvoirs spirituel et politique peuvent être incarnés par un seul homme. Il atténue les excès de la féodalité au profit de la notion de bien commun et développe la justice royale, où le souverain apparaît comme « le justicier suprême ». De cette manière, il fait progressivement passer la France d'une monarchie féodale à une monarchie moderne, ne reposant plus seulement sur les rapports personnels du roi avec ses vassaux, mais sur ceux du roi en tant que chef de l'État avec ses « sujets ». Sous son règne, Paris devient la ville la plus prestigieuse d’Occident avec son Université et ses monuments religieux (Sainte Chapelle, Notre-Dame). Les foires de Champagne favorisent le commerce et permettent la naissance d'une bourgeoisie urbaine active et entreprenante.",2023-04-25 19:08:45+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/25164,,,528,0,0,1,PeerChannel,1596004814.0,souvenirsfrancais,2023-04-25 06:47:36,2023-04-25,https://t.me/souvenirsfrancais/74,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It resulted in the Portuguese transition to democracy and the end of the Portuguese Colonial War. The Carnation Revolution got its name from the fact that almost no shots were fired and from restaurant worker Celeste Caeiro offering carnations to the soldiers when the population took to the streets to celebrate the end of the dictatorship, with other demonstrators following suit and carnations placed in the muzzles of guns and on the soldiers' uniforms. A consequence of the Carnation Revolution was the sudden withdrawal of Portuguese administrative and military personnel from its overseas colonies.

Until the sixth century the practice of what is now called mysticism was referred to by the term contemplatio, c.q. theoria, from contemplatio (Latin; Greek θεωρία, theoria), ""looking at"", ""gazing at"", ""being aware of"" God or the Divine. Christianity took up the use of both the Greek (theoria) and Latin (contemplatio, contemplation) terminology to describe various forms of prayer and the process of coming to know God. Contemplative practices range from simple prayerful meditation of Holy Scripture (i.e. Lectio Divina) to contemplation on the presence of God, resulting in theosis (spiritual union with God) and ecstatic visions of the soul's mystical union with God. Three stages are discerned in contemplative practice, namely catharsis (purification), contemplation proper, and the vision of God. Contemplative practices have a prominent place in the Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy, and have gained a renewed interest in western Christianity.",2023-04-24 01:20:15+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/25049,,,526,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a highly active recognition process whereby knowledge of previously learned scenes and objects are combined with the visual stream from the eye, along with saccadic eye movements and head movements to create a final visual consciousness.

Some of their designs are similar to today’s ear plugs or tunnels. Set into a wide perforation in the wearer’s earlobe (as earspools are today), these ornaments would have been anchored in place in various ways. In some cases, a bead (or beads) were set into the front of the earflare, anchoring it with the help of a set of beaded counterweights that were threaded through the earflare and hung behind the earlobe. Another possibility is that an L-shaped plug (likely made of wood) was fitted through the earflare’s central opening, or stem, from the back, holding the entire assemblage in place, snug against the wearer’s ear. Earflares were seen as small-scale portals, jewel-lined pathways into the human body. One of the most common Maya phrases for death, och bih (literally ""to enter/go on the road""), was depicted in hieroglyphic inscriptions as a snake diving into an earflare. Notably, the high polish Maya craftsman brought to the surfaces of jades cause these ornaments to emit a high, metallic ring when they are struck. For a non-metal using culture, this would have been a rare and beautiful sound. Ornamenting the ears in jade did not just mark them as sacred pathways, but also transformed the sounds heard by the wearer into divine, sacred, perfumed, and precious phenomena.

The mask was invented by Max Factor, a makeup company that was founded in 1909 by a Polish beautician named Maksymilian Faktorowicz who emigrated to the United States in 1904. Max Factor specialized in movie make-up and demonstrated the importance of custom, technical make-up application based on several factors such as facial structure, contours and creative characterization. The mask was targeted towards actors and actresses in Hollywood, helping them look as if they weren't drinking the night before. The invention probably helped with redness, swelling and alcohol bloating in the face but probably did very little to cure the internal pains that come with a hangover.

In 1897, Papus initiated Daria Musina-Pushkina, an actress in Russia’s Imperial Theaters and the prototype for one of the sisters in Chekhov’s famous play. In January 1899, Musina-Pushkina became the order’s Grand Legate in Russia and was tasked with organizing a meeting between the order and Russia’s Imperial couple. Her successor in this role was Valerian Muravyov Amursky, the military attaché of the Russian embassy in Paris.

msg_iteration.34530.user.Davidscave.post.24871,1620420179,Davidscave,24871,,"Mithraism The mysteries were popular among the Imperial Roman army from about the 1st to the 4th century CE. Worshippers of Mithras had a complex system of seven grades of initiation and communal ritual meals. Initiates called themselves syndexioi, those ""united by the handshake"" They met in underground temples, now called mithraea (singular mithraeum). The cult appears to have had its center in Rome, and was popular throughout the western half of the empire, as far south as Roman Africa and Numidia, as far west as Roman Dacia, as far north as Roman Britain,(pp 26–27) and to a lesser extent in Roman Syria in the east. Mithraic initiates were required to swear an oath of secrecy and dedication. Apparently, some grade rituals involved the recital of a catechism, wherein the initiate was asked a series of questions pertaining to the initiation symbolism and had to reply with specific answers. An example of such a catechism, apparently pertaining to the Leo grade, was discovered in a fragmentary Egyptian papyrus (Papyrus Berolinensis 21196) It had no predominant sanctuary or cultic centre; and, although each mithraeum had its own officers and functionaries, there was no central supervisory authority. In some mithraea, such as that at Dura Europos, wall paintings depict prophets carrying scrolls, but no named Mithraic sages are known, nor does any reference give the title of any Mithraic scripture or teaching. It is known that initiates could transfer with their grades from one Mithraeum to another.",2023-04-21 11:21:31+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/24871,,,525,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the story that is alleged to have taken place in 1217, Diego and Isabel were both descendants of noble and influential families. The relationship between the two youngsters did not seem to convince her family, because Juan Diego was not the firstborn and therefore did not have any valuable properties. Due to this reason, Diego requested five years to get richer and finally have the means to ask the hand of his beloved Isabel. His request was granted, and Diego went to war, searching for the promised fortune. However, when he returned to Teruel, the five-year deadline had expired. Isabel, oppressed by her father, married an important nobleman of the city. In the day of the wedding between Isabel and her fiancé, Diego managed to meet with his ladylove at her house and requested a kiss, promptly denied by her. Devastated because of her denial, he falls dead at her feet. In the next day, a funeral is held to Diego in the Church of San Pedro de Teruel. During the funeral, a mourning Isabel comes near Diego's body. She reaches down his face to give him the kiss she denied while he was alive. She does so, but suddenly takes a deep breath and passes away on the body of her lover. They were buried in the Church of San Pedro. Since many people came across Spain to see the Lovers of Teruel, the mummies were exhumed and put into two new tombs that were sculpted by Juan de Ávalos. The tombs are carved out of marble and bear the family shields of Marcilla and Segura, but the most attractive part of the tombs are the lids. The lids are exquisitely carved: one features the strong and handsome Diego, his one arm outstretched, reaching for his love Isabel – his hand comes close to touching her, but because of religious piety they do not touch (since Isabel was married).",2023-04-19 23:04:34+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/24736,,,530,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, three inferences have been drawn: (1) that the psychedelic experience tends to dissolve atheist convictions; (2) that atheist convictions, once dissolved, are replaced with traditional monotheist beliefs; and (3) that atheism and depression somehow correlate as afflictions for which psychedelic drugs offer relief. This paper argues, based on analysis of the studies and trials along with relevant supplemental evidence, that each of these popular inferences is substantially misleading. Survey data do not indicate that most psychedelic atheists have cleanly cut ties with their former convictions, and there is strong evidence that they have not traded atheism for traditional monotheism.

His main concern was a contemporary renewal of ancient philosophy and Plato's teaching was the core, which he interpreted in the sense of the Neoplatonic tradition founded by Plotinus. With his striving for a consistent metaphysical worldview, in which theological and philosophical statements were to merge into an indissoluble unity, he joined the more strongly Christian current of humanism. With this publication, students of Plato had access to the entire range of the dialogues, revealing the rich ancient landscape of myths, allegories, philosophical arguments, etymologies, fragments of poetry, other works of philosophy, aspects of ancient pagan religious practices, concepts of mathematics and natural philosophy.

Then, the teenage girl vanished without a trace. For five years after she went missing, Natasha's family feared the worst and even held a memorial service for her, assuming that she was dead. In reality, she had been hiding out at her much older boyfriend's house — less than a mile from her mother's home. During that time, Natasha had moved about the house freely with the curtains drawn, spending her days cooking, reading, sewing, and hiding in a cupboard whenever people came over. She later explained that she stayed in hiding for so long simply because ""the lie had become too big.""

Fitted with a gag to silence the wearer, this iron muzzle was usually strapped onto women who were brought into public so townspeople could jeer and throw things at them. In 1789, a farmer put a woman in a Scold's Bridle to ""silence her clamorous Tongue"" and paraded her around town as local children ""hooted."" Apparently, ""nobody pitied her because she was very much disliked by her neighbours."" But the bridle wasn't only used on ""scolds."" In 1655, a bridle was used on a Quaker named Dorothy Waugh as punishment for preaching in the marketplace.

He decided to kill his mother for two reasons: first, the young man wanted to get insurance. Secondly, he didn't like that a woman treated him like a child. That day his mother went to Alaska to visit her daughter. She boarded a Douglas DC-6B from United Air Lines. 11 minutes after departure, it exploded. All 44 people on board were killed. During the investigation, it turned out that Jack planted an explosive device in his mother's suitcase. At the trial, he first confessed to what he had done, but later changed his position. Jack insisted that he took the blame under pressure from the authorities. However, few people listened to him: the young man was executed on January 11, 1957. https://history.denverlibrary.org/news/mass-murder-sky-john-gilbert-graham-and-united-flight-629",2023-04-16 08:05:53+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/24507,,,3468,0,11,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Normally, I can remember teaching this 30 years ago, we didn't have to define this because everyone understood... But now a days things have been so vastly redefined..."" He observed the historical and ideological shift meaning, ""...[Karl Marx] sees the family as 'just a product of industrialised society'.. to the United Nations, family is 'whatever anyone wants it to be, and everyone is invited'... so you can have anything... same sex, homosexual, lesbian as all lumped in... Jane Shultz is the coordinator of the international year of the family, she says the family is 'such a subjective thing'. Really? ...Ideas have consequences. The way you think about, and conceive about family, the role of the husband, the role of the wife, the role of the father, the function of children in the family.. Drastically affect not only the family, but also all of society.""",2023-04-16 03:17:23+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/24456,,,390,0,6,1,PeerChannel,1497242922.0,vaultofsecrets,2023-04-15 11:38:07,2023-04-15,https://t.me/vaultofsecrets/12181,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,video/mp4,5.89525332430265e+18,1575.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If wrong or impure thoughts seek entrance to your mind, close and lock your mental doors to them. If thoughts of desire try to drive out thoughts of duty, be heroic and insist that thoughts of duty shall have right of way. In short, see that you are the master of your thinking, and do not let it always be directed without your consent by influences outside of yourself. It is just at this point that the strong will wins victory and the weak will breaks down. Between the ability to control one's thoughts and the inability to control them lies all the difference between right actions and wrong actions; between withstanding temptation and yielding to it; between an inefficient purposeless life and a life of purpose and endeavor... success and failure.""

The episode depicted here comes from the Bible in the Book of Revelation, which describes the struggle between Satan & Saint Michael: — Revelation (Apocalypse) 12:7–9 (Bible) “And there was War in Heaven: Michael & his Angels fought against the Dragon; & the Dragon fought & his Angels, & prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the great Dragon was cast out, that old Serpent, called the Devil, & Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, & his Angels were cast out with him.” Palomino was perhaps the greatest of the Spanish Baroque fresco painters. His technique & style were crucially influenced by the arrival in Madrid in 1692 of Luca Giordano, resulting in a fusion of the Neapolitan style with his own Madrid training. Works such as those in the great vault of the church of the Santos Juanes, Valencia (since destroyed), & in the chapel of the Virgen de los Desamparados, Valencia, show Palomino's grasp of the Neapolitan unified sense of space. Palomino painted many works on canvas, many of which were originally commissioned as altarpieces, & of which one of the finest, an Immaculate Conception, is in the Prado museum in Madrid, Spain.",2023-04-12 10:49:08+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/24219,,,458,0,5,1,PeerChannel,1224324472.0,,2023-04-12 10:20:11,2023-04-12,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear.

John Gofman, professor emeritus of molecular and cell biology, estimates that at least two-thirds - and probably 75% or more - of the 182,000 cases of breast cancer diagnosed each year are due to X-rays received up to 60 years ago for a variety of medical conditions... Gofman reached his conclusions after spending more than six months delving into the medical literature on past use of X-rays, concentrating on articles published between 1920 and the 1970s... an era when overzealous doctors X-rayed patients for a broad range of benign ailments, not suspecting it might have consequences decades later... Even as recently as the 1960s mammograms to detect breast cancer sometimes delivered more than 100 times the maximum allowed radiation dose today...""

With the words ""this is my body, this is my blood,"" he shares bread and wine with them, thus instituting the Holy Eucharist (Greek for ""thanksgiving""). Today, Catholics celebrate this event at every Mass. During the Eucharist, the priest transforms the bread and wine into Jesus' body and blood. Jesus voluntarily gives himself to suffering and washes the feet of the 12 apostles as a sign of his love. In the solemn Mass, the priest imitates this action, following Jesus' command: ""Love one another as I have loved you."" After Communion, Jesus goes with Peter, John and James to the Mount of Olives and asks them to stay with him and pray with him. This is why Catholics watch and pray with Christ on this ""Night of the Mount of Olives."" He knows that he will be betrayed by the apostle Judas and arrested in the early morning.",2023-04-06 17:55:07+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/23836,,,616,1,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

John R. Stockwell (born 1937) is a former CIA officer who became a critic of United States government policies after serving seven tours of duty over thirteen years. Having managed American involvement in the Angolan Civil War as Chief of the Angola Task Force during its 1975 covert operations, he resigned and wrote In Search of Enemies. As a Marine, Stockwell was a CIA paramilitary intelligence case officer in three wars: the Congo Crisis, the Vietnam War, and the Angolan War of Independence. His military rank is Major. Beginning his career in 1964, Stockwell spent six years in Africa, Chief of Base in the Katanga during the Bob Denard invasion in 1968, then Chief of Station in Bujumbura, Burundi in 1970, before being transferred to Vietnam to oversee intelligence operations in the Tay Ninh province and was awarded the CIA Intelligence Medal of Merit for keeping his post open until the last days of the fall of Saigon in 1975. In December 1976, he resigned from the CIA, citing deep concerns for the methods and results of CIA paramilitary operations in Third World countries and testified before Congressional committees. Two years later, he wrote the exposé In Search of Enemies, about that experience and its broader implications. He claimed that the CIA was counterproductive to national security, and that its ""secret wars"" provided no benefit for the United States. The CIA, he stated, had singled out the MPLA to be an enemy in Angola despite the fact that the MPLA wanted relations with the United States and had not committed a single act of aggression against the United States. In 1978 he appeared on the popular American television program 60 Minutes, claiming that CIA Director William Colby and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger had systematically lied to Congress about the CIA's operations.

msg_iteration.35657.user.Davidscave.post.23729,1620420179,Davidscave,23729,,"What is the story behind the idea of Russia as the third Rome? This ideological and political concept was based on the doctrine that Russia or, specifically, Moscow was the spiritual successor to the legacy of first ancient Rome and Constantinople (second Rome), capital of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire. After the conversion to Christianity of Rus in the 10th century, Russians recognized the authority of the Byzantine Emperor as protector of all Christians. The idea that Russia is the Third Rome was started by the last heiress of the Byzantine Empire, Sophia Palaiologina. Sophia was the niece of Konstantinos Paleologos, the last Byzantine Emperor, who married the Tsar of Russia, Ivan III (the Great). She was raised to view Constantinople as the Second Rome, a successor to the Roman Empire. The fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 came as an immense shock to her. Her beloved childhood home was now a part of the Ottoman Empire. From then onwards, she worked vigorously to promote Moscow as the Third Rome. The idea of the Third Rome was embraced by both the secular and the ecclesiastical authorities in Muscovy by the 16th century. Russia already had Byzantine culture, but Sophia further introduced grand Byzantine ceremonies into the Kremlin. Ivan III adopted their imperial two-headed eagle (from Byzantium) as the emblem and named himself the tsar (Russian for “Caesar”). The doctrine of Moscow as the Third Rome had broad circulation until the fall of the Russian Empire in the early 20th century.",2023-04-05 11:54:21+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/23729,,,545,12,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.35700.user.Davidscave.post.23686,1620420179,Davidscave,23686,,"""Dr. Death"" and Prisoner Mockery Dr. Leo Stanley was the chief surgeon of the famous American prison of St. Quentin. During his tenure he conducted many gruesome experiments on prisoners, including a testicular implantation experiment. Stanley later explained that in this way he tried to find a way to rejuvenate and reduce people's appetite for cruelty. True, he did it in a strange way: he took the testicles of executed criminals, as well as the testicles of rams, goats and boars, and implanted them into convicts. Naturally, rejection began, often with complications. It was real torture, though Stanley himself believed that the suffering of the prisoners in this case was for the benefit of all mankind. https://pleasekillme.com/american-frankenstein-san-quentin-surgeon-experiments/",2023-04-04 19:05:03+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/23686,,,3715,1,38,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Constructing the most unimaginable monsters, combining elements of the living and the inanimate in one creature, creating spaces where illusion intertwines with reality, Bosch was unlike anyone else and amazingly inventive.

But his language is so individual that entire generations of historians have argued about the meaning of these images, putting forward many competing and sometimes directly opposite interpretations.",2023-04-02 10:18:12+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/23421,,,815,2,9,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a radioactive metal that is used in a variety of applications, including as a neutron source for portable neutron generators and as a source of alpha particles for analysis of samples. Californium-252 is the most widely used isotope of californium. Due to its relatively long half-life and high neutron output per decay, it is an attractive source of neutrons for portable neutron generators. #californium 252 price per gram #californium252",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They even created a name to call people: “ litterbugs ”. About 20 companies (such as Coca Cola and Pepsi ) got together and created the anti-trash movement ""Keep America Beautiful"" (Keep America beautiful) and it was then that they managed to make the blame for garbage stop being the brands and became the consumers'. The most famous advertisement of the “Keep America Beautiful” movement was “ The Crying Indian ”.

However, in the ancient Assyrian, Akkadian and Babylonian traditions, the spring festival was celebrated in the first days of the month known as ""Nisan"" and the calendar adopted by the ancient Assyrians had the month ""Nisan"" at the beginning of the calendar In the Julian calendar, the vernal equinox moved gradually away from 21 March. The Gregorian calendar reform restored the vernal equinox to its original date, but since the festival was by now tied to the date, not the astronomical event, Kha b-Nisan remains fixed at 21 March in the Julian reckoning, corresponding to 1 April in the Gregorian calendar. Due to its modern alignment with April Fool's Day, the festival is often more lighthearted than its historical counterpart. It is a tradition in Assyrian villages for girls to gather flowers and herbs which are then suspended under the house's roof or made into a garland for a home's front door.",2023-04-01 11:59:16+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/23368,,,590,0,8,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The background is a barren landscape in which scenes of destruction are still taking place. In the foreground, Death leads his armies from his reddish horse, destroying the world of the living. The latter are led to an enormous coffin with no hope for salvation. All of the social institutions are included in this composition and neither power nor devotion can save them. Some attempt to struggle against their dark destiny while others are resigned to their fate. Only a pair of lovers, at the lower right, remains outside the future they too will have to suffer. This painting depicts a customary theme in medieval literature: the dance of Death, which was frequently used by Northern artists. Bruegel casts the entire work in a reddish-brown tone that gives the scene an infernal aspect appropriate for the subject at hand. This scene is influenced by both the medieval tradition of the Dance of Death and by depictions of the Triumph of Death in Italian painting. The profusion of scenes and moralizing sense applied by the artists are part of Hieronymous Bosch's influence on this work.",2023-03-31 11:00:23+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/23238,,,397,0,1,1,PeerChannel,1224324472.0,,2023-03-31 09:44:06,2023-03-31,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The skull symbolized life and death and the accused were required to take a sacred oath of truth of their testimony with his or her hand placed atop the skull. Known as the Vehmgerichte, or criminal tribunals, this system of courts arose from the need to curb the rampant crime and warfare that sprung from feudalism, which often resulted in those with power taking advantage of innocent citizens. When the Holy Roman emperors were unable to control these often heinous offenses, they were brought to the Vehmic courts. These courts handled capital crimes, with the only possible verdicts being either acquittal or death. Accusations were made by a summons to the accused that was either nailed to his door, or to some convenient place where he was certain to pass. Six weeks and three days' grace were allowed, according to the old Saxon law, during which the summons was repeated a maximum of three times. If the accused appeared as directed, the accuser stated the case, and the investigation proceeded by the examination of witnesses as in an ordinary court of law.",2023-03-30 15:31:44+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/23181,,,516,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.36261.user.Davidscave.post.23107,1620420179,Davidscave,23107,,"Since 1958, the terms Beat Generation and Beat have been used to describe the antimaterialistic literary movement that began with Kerouac in the 1940s and continued into the 1960s. The Beat philosophy of antimaterialism and soul searching influenced 1960s musicians such as Bob Dylan, the early Pink Floyd and The Beatles. The Beat philosophy was generally countercultural and antimaterialistic, and stressed the importance of bettering one's inner self over material possessions. Some Beat writers, such as Gary Snyder, began to delve into Eastern religions such as Buddhism and Taoism. Politics tended to be liberal, left-wing and anti-war, with support for causes such as desegregation (although many of the figures associated with the original Beat movement, particularly Kerouac, embraced libertarian and conservative ideas). An openness to African American culture and arts was apparent in literature and music, notably jazz. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatnik",2023-03-30 00:07:08+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/23107,,,476,3,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That small change in location, however, has not deterred tourists from stopping to see the lovely statue in all her glory.Upon first glance, it is obvious that people have a fascination with her breasts. When visiting, it would be hard not to look at them as they are quite a noticeable feature. In fact, they are a different shade of bronze than the rest of the statue due to all the contact that they have had over the years.[5]Some think that she was a prostitute. Others believe that she caught fish. Either way, she is a tourist favorite. However, there does not seem to be much evidence about her breasts bringing good luck.

msg_iteration.36545.user.Davidscave.post.22811,1620420179,Davidscave,22811,,"Gottfried ""Götz"" von Berlichingen was a German (Franconian) Imperial Knight (Reichsritter), mercenary and poet. He was born around 1480 into the noble family of Berlichingen in modern-day Baden-Württemberg. His name became famous as a euphemism for a vulgar expression (Er kann mich am Arsch lecken – ""He can lick my ass"" though in the play it is written as ""He can kiss my ass"") attributed to him by writer and poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who wrote a play based on his life. In 1504, during the War of the Succession of Landshut, Berlichingen and his mercenary army fought for Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria. During the siege of the city of Landshut, he lost his right arm at the wrist when cannon fire forced his sword against him. In the following years, he had two mechanical prosthetic iron replacements made. The first iron hand was a more simple device, claimed to have been made by a local blacksmith and a saddle maker. The second, more famous prosthetic hand was capable of holding objects from a shield or reins to a quill. Both are on display today at the Burg Jagsthausen.",2023-03-27 12:18:25+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/22811,,,464,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was Timucuan Territory whose warriors averaged 7-8 ft tall according to Spanish and French accounts. According to native oral tradition these giants were descendants of the star people who fell from the heavens and took our women in the ancient times. The tribes of giants were born from these “unions” Pictured here is the sacrifice of the first-born son. The mother would cover her face as the child was brought to the chief by another woman. Other women would dance in a circle. When the dancing ended, a warrior would club the child to death on the tree stump. The dead child was then eaten by the chief. This was also a custom among giant tribes in Central Mexico who fed the sacrifices baby or child to the chief or priest.

What is special is that the hollow chest area can be closed with a small lid. One or more substantially smaller ceramic figures were originally in the interior of the body; they represent various strata of the society, such as warrior, ruler, merchant, or richly adorned women of the Teotihuacan elite – thus the term ""host figure"". The ritual character of such figures is obvious. But archaeologists have not yet been able to clearly attribute a specific function to these finds.

Echoing very old myths of secret cultic practices in many prehistoric societies, the claim, as it is leveled against Jews, was rarely attested to in antiquity. According to Tertullian, it originally emerged in late antiquity as an accusation made against members of the early Christian community of the Roman Empire. Once this accusation had been dismissed, it was revived a millennium later as a Christian slander against Jews in the medieval period. The first examples of medieval blood libel emerged in England in the mid 1100s before spreading into other parts of Europe, especially France and Germany. This libel, alongside those of well poisoning and host desecration, became a major theme of the persecution of Jews in Europe from that period down to modern times.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Called the “blood libel,” these accusations first appeared in England and were attested across Western Europe from the twelfth century to the modern era. In Blois, the blood libel accusations lead to the dramatic death of more than 30 members of the community. The survivors’ estates were confiscated. Ten years later, King Philippe Augustus expelled the Jews from the royal domain. Anti-Semitism received the Church’s support in the early thirteenth century at the Fourth Lateran Council (1215). The council invited kings and rulers to force the Jews of their kingdoms to wear a distinctive symbol on their clothes or a specific hat that would make them immediately recognizable by Christians. In 1269, Louis IX of France made the symbols mandatory.",2023-03-25 12:58:52+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/22599,,,504,0,10,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Madness and Civilization, Foucault traced the origins of psychiatry to the establishment of the Hôpital general in Paris in 1656. These were not hospitals in our sense of the word, but rather public asylums for les misérables. Szasz traces psychiatry’s origins to the widespread use of private madhouses in England, where relatives would send their unwanted family members (see Parry-Jones’s -The Trade in Lunacy). In his Preface to the first edition of The Myth of Mental Illness (1961), Szasz wrote that he had a twofold purpose: My first task, accordingly, is to present an essentially “destructive” analysis of the concept of mental illness and of psychiatry as a pseudomedical enterprise….My second task is to offer a “constructive” synthesis of the knowledge which I have found useful for filling the gap left by the myth of mental illness https://www.madinamerica.com/2022/09/thomas-szasz-versus/",2023-03-25 00:06:39+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/22562,,,559,0,12,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaWebPage,1,https://www.madinamerica.com/2022/09/thomas-szasz-versus/,madinamerica.com,Thomas Szasz Versus the Mental Health Movement,Unbiased experts must examine the claims of psychiatry and report on the justification for its routine use of imprisonment and torture.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Koralewsky (1872-1941) Institute of Chicago Frank L. Koralewsky served as a traditional ironworker’s apprentice in his native north-German town of Stralsund. After obtaining journeyman status, he worked in various German shops before immigrating to Boston in the mid- 1890s. By 1906 he was a member of the Boston Society of Arts and Crafts, specializing in locksmithing and hardware. This extremely intricate lock, which took seven years to complete, exemplifies the early-20th-century taste for sentimental medievalism and represents the pinnacle of the metalworking tradition at the turn of the 20th century. Exhibited at the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition, where it won a gold medal, the lock illustrates Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm’s fairy tale “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”",2023-03-24 10:58:40+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/22496,,,777,0,13,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Self sacrifice is a Holy Law which must enter the hearts and minds of men to make them strong. Self sacrifice is related to love. Only someone who feels love, can sacrifice themselves. Where love is absent, life becomes meaningless, and then people put their expectations onto other people instead of God... He who only talks about love, but does not show it, is like an empty barrel that makes noise and yields nothing... See how fruit and wheat ripen, and on their own sacrifice themselves for mankind's benefit. So true sacrifice is a voluntary act... Lots of work is needed... Why should the preacher give his sermons? Its needed by the preacher and by the one to who hears it. Why must a mother give birth? This is good both for her, and for her neighbours... Understanding this shows that a person knows his Father, and like Christ can say, ""As the Father knows me, so I know Him and I am ready to sacrifice myself for His sheep.""

Psyche started life as a beautiful mortal and became a goddess when Zeus, the ruler of the Olympians, ordained her marriage to Eros, the god of love who was the son of Aphrodite. In a legend that later became the basis for “Beauty and the Beast, the goddess Psyche, unlike most of the other Greek goddesses, acquired her status as a goddess by “marrying up”. The loving Psyche then proved herself worthy of the honor. Psyche had to prove her worth to her mother-in-law, the goddess Aphrodite, by accomplishing a series of dangerous feats that were seemingly impossible. By successfully learning the lessons these tasks required, the goddess Psyche embarked on a remarkable journey of self-discovery and personal growth that earned her the respect of all the gods and goddesses on Mount Olympus, not to mention the respect and undying love of her husband. Her teachings and lessons assist us in learning how to confront all the dark and mysterious places of the soul. Through these trials, Psyche was well-prepared for her eventual union with her beloved. Her history reminds us that the integration of our experiences, however sad or frightening they may be, mature and transform us, like her symbol, the butterfly, emerging into the light from the darkness of the cocoon. “Psyche” Mixed Media *She Who Is pg text 2022",2023-03-19 13:47:16+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/22177,,,475,0,1,1,,,,2022-11-14 11:59:16,2022-11-14,,0,,,1,MessageMediaWebPage,1,https://youtu.be/2vm7bRwxLhs,youtu.be,The Stars Are Dancing,Provided to YouTube by The Orchard EnterprisesThe Stars Are Dancing · Thomas Howe · Stephen TaitMagical Fantasy℗ 2015 PURPLE FOX LIMITEDReleased on: 2015-03-...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is notable for having chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and initial conditions. In particular, the Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions of the Lorenz system. In popular media the ""butterfly effect"" stems from the real-world implications of the Lorenz attractor, namely that in a chaotic physical system, in the absence of perfect knowledge of the initial conditions (even the minuscule disturbance of the air due to a butterfly flapping its wings), our ability to predict its future course will always fail. This underscores that physical systems can be completely deterministic and yet still be inherently unpredictable.

Military affairs specialist Chuck DeCaro: Electronic mind-control research is not new. A scientific milestone in this area came in the 1960s when Dr. Jose Delgado demonstrated remote control over a charging bull. By connecting a radio antenna to electrodes inserted into the bull's brain, Delgado proved that the animal's aggressive impulses could be thwarted by electronically manipulating the bull's muscle reflexes. Delgado Do you realize the fantastic possibilities if from the outside we could modify the inside; could we give messages to the inside? But the beauty is that now we are not using electrodes. DeCaro In recent years Delgado has shown that the behavior of monkeys can be altered using low-power pulsing magnetic fields. But in these experiments, there were no antenna implants. Delgado Any function in the brain -- emotions, intellect, personality -- could we perhaps modify by this non-invasive technology. DeCaro Delgado's research has so far been limited to animals. But in the Soviet Union a radio frequency, or RF, device has been used for over 30 years to manipulate the moods of mental patients.

msg_iteration.37261.user.Davidscave.post.22079,1620420179,Davidscave,22079,,"This is a 1762 illustration of a woman warding off the devil with her genitalia. The illustration was used to accompany the poem, “The Devil of Pope Fig Island,” written by a 17th century French poet by the name of Jean de la Fontaine. The poem is pretty long, so I’ll just give you the gist of the story. One day a devil randomly shows up to a small village on Pope Fig Island and starts causing a ruckus and terrorizing the villagers. The devil then approaches a farmer named Phil and demands that he give him half his crops. Phil complies and gives the devil half of his crops, but he only gives him the leaves and stems and not the actual vegetables. The devil is embarrassed and annoyed at being outwitted by a lowly farmer and threatens to punish Phil and take his portion of the vegetables within a week’s time. Frightened, Phil runs home and tells his wife, Perretta, what had happened. She tells him to not worry and that she’ll take care of the devil. When the devil returns, Phil jumps into a tub of holy water for protection. Perretta greets the devil with tears and disheveled hair. She tells the devil that Phil is a terrifying man who beats her mercilessly and even gave her a deep gash with his claws. This is when Perretta lifts her skirt to show the devil her genitalia. The devil is horrified and runs away, never to return. Here’s the passage from the poem that describes the exact event of the illustration: “For God's sake try, my lord, to get away; Just now I heard the savage fellow say, He'd with his claws your lordship tear and slash: See, only see, my lord, he made this gash; On which she showed:—what you will guess, no doubt, And put the demon presently to rout, Who crossed himself and trembled with affright: He'd never seen nor heard of such a sight, Where scratch from claws or nails had so appeared; His fears prevailed, and off he quickly steered…” If you want to read the entire poem, please refer to the original source: https://archive.org/details/talesnovelsinver02lafoiala/page/n213/mode/2up",2023-03-18 12:48:27+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/22079,,,466,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaWebPage,1,https://archive.org/details/talesnovelsinver02lafoiala/page/n213/mode/2up,archive.org,"Tales and Novels in verse : La Fontaine, Jean de, 1621-1695 : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive",2 v. :,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He got his nickname because of the black clothes he usually wore, in addition, frightened witnesses said that he acted incredibly fast during the burglaries. So, ending one of the reports, the anchor asked: ""Where is that Black Panther...?"" which finally cemented his nickname.

It is sometimes used poetically and generally to refer to the island, but is less common than 'Britain' today. The name for Scotland in most of the Celtic languages is related to Albion: Alba in Scottish Gaelic, Albain (genitive Alban) in Irish, Nalbin in Manx and Alban in Welsh and Cornish. These names were later Latinised as Albania and Anglicised as Albany, which were once alternative names for Scotland. In the Balkans, the region where founders of the Bogomil movement lived was called “Albania”; just like today’s modern country. Whether Albi’s founders were inspired by these ancient names or the Celtic Elf-Fairy concepts affected their name preferences, two things seem quite certain: Albi, the town which later became the heartland of the Cathar movement, was one of the settlements in Europe that resisted the Christianization of Rome with its historical roots. New Albion and Albionoria (""Albion of the North"") were briefly suggested as names of Canada during the period of the Canadian Confederation. Sir Francis Drake gave the name New Albion to what is now California when he landed there in 1579.",2023-03-17 12:19:29+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/22012,,,539,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.37363.user.Davidscave.post.21977,1620420179,Davidscave,21977,,"Chaff, originally called Window by the British and Düppel by the Second World War era German Luftwaffe (from the Berlin suburb where it was first developed), is a radar countermeasure in which aircraft or other targets spread a cloud of small, thin pieces of aluminium, metallized glass fibre or plastic, which either appears as a cluster of primary targets on radar screens or swamps the screen with multiple returns, in order to confuse and distract. Modern armed forces use chaff (in naval applications, for instance, using short-range SRBOC rockets) to distract radar-guided missiles from their targets. Most military aircraft and warships have chaff dispensing systems for self-defense. An intercontinental ballistic missile may release in its midcourse phase several independent warheads as well as penetration aids such as decoy balloons and chaff. Modern radar systems can distinguish chaff from target objects by measuring the Doppler shift; chaff quickly loses speed compared to an aircraft and thus shows a characteristic change in frequency that allows it to be filtered out. This has led to new techniques where the chaff is further illuminated by an additional signal from the target vehicle with the proper Doppler frequency. This is known as JAFF (jammer plus chaff) or CHILL (chaff-illuminated).",2023-03-16 10:24:52+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/21977,,,474,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.37402.user.Davidscave.post.21938,1620420179,Davidscave,21938,,"The ""fruit machine"" was a device developed in Canada by Frank Robert Wake, a psychology professor with Carleton University in the 1950s that was supposed to be able to identify gay men (derogatorily referred to as ""fruits""). The subjects were made to view pornography; the device then measured the diameter of the pupils of the eyes (pupillary response test), perspiration, and pulse for a supposed erotic response. The machine was employed in Canada in the 1950s and 1960s during a campaign to eliminate all gay men from the civil service, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and the military. A substantial number of workers did lose their jobs. Although funding for the project was cut off in the late 1960s, the investigations continued, and the RCMP collected files on 9,000 people who had been investigated. The machine used a chair similar to that used by dentists. It had a pulley with a camera going towards the pupils, with a black box located in front of it that displayed pictures. The pictures ranged from the mundane to sexually explicit photos of men and women. It had previously been determined that the pupils would dilate in relation to the amount of interest in the picture, in a technique termed ""the pupillary response test"". People were first led to believe that the machine's purpose was to rate stress. After knowledge of its real purpose became widespread, few people volunteered for it.",2023-03-15 20:28:40+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/21938,,,380,1,4,1,PeerChannel,1620420179.0,Davidscave,2023-03-15 20:24:11,2023-03-15,https://t.me/Davidscave/21934,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Théon gathered a number of students, including Louis Themanlys and Charles Barlet, and they established the ""Cosmic Movement"".

Felix Gretarsson underwent the world’s first double arm transplant. The journey took more than twenty years. How it happened is miraculous. Subscribe» https://7news.link/MyBigStory Be sure to follow Felix for regular updates on his incredible recovery, and life here: https://www.instagram.com/felix_gretarsson/ https://www.facebook.com/FelixGretarsson/ January 12, 1998. Felix Gretarsson was a young electrician working in Reykjavík, Iceland. The then 26-year-old had two young daughters. One was 4 years old, and the other was just 3 months. Early that freezing January morning, Felix was sent to investigate a fault on one of the power lines in a remote area. “The weather was minus 11 degrees Celsius, blowing in, in my face. “I was keeping my head down, just walking and looking for the pole, which had been damaged. It was so hard to see what was happening. But, I went up the one which was meant to be correct.” “I reached up and grabbed the line, and apparently it was the wrong one. So I got 11,000 volts and 100 amps running through my arms. “Somehow, there was just too much power, so the full charge didn’t travel through my whole body. “It jumped between my arms, and to the ground, which kind of saved my life.” “If it had travelled through my body, it would have gone through my heart, and I wouldn’t be here. “And another thing that saved my life in this instance, was I had loosened my lifeline - a special rope that was meant to keep me from falling. “But luckily, it failed. So instead of, you know, being there until I was just burnt to a crisp, I fell down. “Both my arms were on fire. They were like candles. “I broke my back in three places, fractured my neck, I think most of my ribs broke loose also. “So it was not a good morning.” Perhaps the understatement of the century. Felix’s colleagues rushed to help him, filling up water bottles to put out his arm fires. But there was little they could do. The true extent of the damage was revealed when Felix was taken to hospital. “They took a biopsy and went higher and higher and higher and found no blood flow or anything, because my arms were just like charcoal.” Felix had both arms amputated. But would go on an incredible journey that would lead to hin getting the world's first double arm transplant, thanks to Professor Jean-Michel Dubernard. It id an important lesson about how crucial organ transplantation and donation is. Watch Felix's remarkable story.

The president of the Soviet Agriculture Academy, Nikolai Vavilov, who had been Lysenko's mentor, was sent to prison and died there, while Soviet genetics research was effectively destroyed. Research and teaching in the fields of neurophysiology, cell biology, and many other biological disciplines were harmed or banned. In recent years, Russian scientists have published several controversial books in which a ‘re-thinking’ of the role of Lysenko is demanded. These modern Lysenkoists claim that their hero was a forerunner of epigenetics and aim to re-write the history of biology along these lines",2023-03-14 20:19:45+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/21860,,,491,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was here that his in - terest in vernalization would take on a new and ultimately dangerous angle due to his encountering the work of Russian horticulturist Ivan Michurin. In 1955, a US Special Sub-committee on the Investigation of Federal Activities described Michurin as, ""A lit-tle-known Russian horticulturist who believed in the hereditary transmission of acquired characteristics."" Whereas previously vernalization allowed the elimination of winter wheat growth cycles and early flow-ering, Lysenko now believed that exposing plant seeds to further temperature experiments would not be necessarv. In the most basic of terms, Lysenko believed that characteristics acquired by one crop could be learnt. As Loren Graham explains: ""Winter wheat and spring wheat are two different va-rieties. You have to decide which one you're going to plant. He maintained he could convert one into the other just by changing the environmental conditions, and that he could do this in just one or two generations. Why? Because acquired characteristics can be in - herited."" This is most vividly explained by media statements that Siberia could be transformed into a land of 'oranges and lemons’",2023-03-14 20:18:42+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/21857,,,496,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bathtubs are designed to relax and soak after a hard day’s work, but they can be used for much more. Swiss engineer Hannes Roth decided he wanted to turn a bathtub into a racing car. Being a racing driver himself, he knew what it would take, so he spent 300 hours modifying a bathtub for a world record attempt. Roth fixed a bathtub to a go-kart chassis and attached a four-cylinder Yamaha engine as well as essential bathtub extras like a showerhead. After many test runs, Roth took the motorized tub to Dynamic Test Center in Vauffelin, Switzerland, for the world record attempt. On May 6, 2016, the bathtub reached an average speed of 116.08 mph (186.82 km/h) with the highest speed of 118 mph (189.9 km/h).",2023-03-14 06:07:34+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/21808,,,1004,0,10,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Missing more payments worsens the repossession cycle. The vehicle would produce an “incessant and unpleasant sound” and if the driver still does not pay, they would be locked out of their vehicle.

He painted historical, classical and religious subjects in the academic style. He was also well known as a portrait painter. According to Diccionario Enciclopedico Salvat, Cabanel is the best representative of the L'art pompier and Napoleon III's preferred painter. Cabanel entered the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris at the age of seventeen, and studied with François-Édouard Picot. He exhibited at the Paris Salon for the first time in 1844, and won the Prix de Rome scholarship in 1845 at the age of 22. Cabanel was elected a member of the Institute in 1863. He was appointed professor at the École des Beaux-Arts in 1864 and taught there until his death. He was closely connected to the Paris Salon: ""He was elected regularly to the Salon jury and his pupils could be counted by the hundred at the Salons. Through them, Cabanel did more than any other artist of his generation to form the character of belle époque French painting"". His refusal together with William-Adolphe Bouguereau to allow the impressionist painter Édouard Manet and many other painters to exhibit their work in the Salon of 1863 led to the establishment of the Salon des Refusés by the French government. Cabanel won the Grande Médaille d'Honneur at the Salons of 1865, 1867, and 1878. A successful academic painter, his 1863 painting The Birth of Venus is one of the best known examples of 19th-century academic painting. The picture was bought by the emperor Napoleon III; there is also a smaller replica (painted in 1875 for a banker, John Wolf) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. It was given to them by Wolf in 1893.",2023-03-12 16:50:46+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/21633,,,448,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Influenced by Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism, countries such as Japan, China, Korea and Vietnam all value to wisdom imparted by elders and treat them with a high degree of respect. In China, where the Confucian principle of filial piety (a family’s eldest son taking on the responsibility of caring for his parents in old age) is observed, a law passed in 2013 that punishes adult children who don’t visit their elderly parents. Respect for elders is literally enshrined in Chinese law. Japan’s Okinawa is another example of a “Blue Zone” (that is, a region with a high proportion of people 100 years or older), and again, this longevity is partly thanks to the care and regard shown for the elderly. Research conducted across mainland Japan shows that more than half the population of Japanese people over the age of 60 lived with their children — a figure three to 10 times greater than what was found in Western countries.",2023-03-12 15:58:55+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/21610,,,484,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each day the women drink a cup of water in which the POWDERED WEED has been boiled.” (p227-28, emphasis added). In recommending Stevia as a stealth method to curb “overpopulation,” Ehrlich further explains that animal experiments showed a 57-79% reduction in fertility lasting up to 2 months after use. Stevia is the new “hot” sweetener, at every Starbucks and wherever else. It often goes by the name “Truvia” as well.

msg_iteration.37758.user.Davidscave.post.21566,1620420179,Davidscave,21566,,"The most widespread use of Nibelung is used to denote the Burgundian royal house, also known as the Gibichungs (German) or Gjúkingar (Old Norse). A group of royal brothers led by king Gunther or Gunnar, the Gibichungs are responsible for the death of the hero Siegfried or Sigurd and are later destroyed at the court of Attila the Hun (called Etzel in German and Atli in Old Norse). This is the only use of the term attested in the Old Norse legends. The earliest probable surviving mention of the name is in the Latin poem Waltharius, believed to have been composed around the year 920. In lines 555–6 of that poem Walter, seeing Guntharius (Gunther) and his men approaching says (in the Chronicon Novaliciense text, usually taken to be the oldest): Nōn assunt Avarēs hīc, sed Francī Nivilōnēs, cultōrēs regiōnis. The translation is: ""These are not Avars, but Frankish Nivilons, inhabitants of the region."" This is the only text to connect the Nibelungs with Franks. Since Burgundy was conquered by the Franks in 534, Burgundians could loosely be considered Franks of a kind and confused with them. The name Nibelunc became a Frankish personal name in the 8th and 9th centuries, at least among the descendants of Childebrand I (who died in 752). Yet, in this poem, the center of Gunther's supposedly Frankish kingdom is the city of Worms on the Rhine.",2023-03-11 14:23:43+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/21566,,,507,1,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This land and its inhabitants give their name to the ""hoard of the Nibelungs"".

The works are based loosely on characters from Germanic heroic legend, namely Norse legendary sagas and the Nibelungenlied. The plot revolves around a magic ring that grants the power to rule the world, forged by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich from gold he stole from the Rhine maidens in the river Rhine. With the assistance of the god Loge, Wotan – the chief of the gods – steals the ring from Alberich, but is forced to hand it over to the giants Fafner and Fasolt in payment for building the home of the gods, Valhalla, or they will take Freia, who provides the gods with the golden apples that keep them young.

In this stunning footage, we see the whale displaying its remarkable defense mechanism while panicking as it tries to escape from the relentless seal. The dwarf sperm whale is a unique and fascinating species, known for its small size and elusive nature. It typically grows to be only around 9 feet long and weighs between 300 and 600 pounds. Despite its small size, however, the whale is equipped with an impressive array of defense mechanisms that allow it to survive in the wild. In the video, we see the whale in a moment of intense distress as it tries to escape the seal’s grasp. The whale’s first line of defense is its ability to release a cloud of dark ink into the water, which confuses and disorients potential predators.

It is a worldview which offers a convincing, and sober, solution to the problem of suffering. And it promotes a life of meaningful and productive action, thus functioning as an antidote to the passivity that has infected the zeitgeist of modern civilization. If, therefore, we choose to partake in the circle of power, or what amounts to the cycle of continual self-overcoming, we will facilitate the actualization of our potential and cultivate the “great happiness” and “great health” that is the prerogative of the seeker of power.",2023-03-11 02:05:33+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/21509,,,429,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was made of wool or leather and had a longer round tip, which was usually turned forward or fell towards the forehead. It could also be tied under the chin with ribbons falling down the sides. The neck part sometimes covered the temples and sometimes reached the shoulders. The Phrygian cap was originally a tanned bull's scrotum along with the surrounding fur. According to the Greeks, such a garment was supposed to transfer the special abilities of the animal to its wearer. Similar pointed caps are known today by garden gnomes, Santa Claus - both in red color - and cartoon characters like the Smurfs or the Mainzelmännchen.",2023-03-10 18:53:15+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/21448,,,2109,4,38,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a 2015 article, Dean McCleland, a Rhodesian wrote that by chance he met a former secret service agent in South Africa, in 1987, who showed him the very date which was agreed between the USA and South Africa as the collapse of the South African Nationalist government - it had been delayed by agreement for reduced help to Rhodesia (to help it's collapse). The appointed date was set as 1993, but it occurred in 1994. This was already pre-planned in 1976. Some of the 70s meetings have since been leaked or declassified. This should confirm some people's suspicion that things can be planned far ahead. One of the few sources which predicted the planned destruction, was the newspaper ""Combat"", the ""official organ of the British National Party,"" which was labelled as ""anti-sematic"" and ""fascist."" Yet, in 1966, it stated amongst other things that if Ian Smith fails in Rhodesia ""civilisation dies in Africa"" and that ""the UN plans an invasion of South Africa.""",2023-03-09 18:32:04+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/21376,,,467,2,16,1,PeerChannel,1497242922.0,vaultofsecrets,2023-03-09 18:21:30,2023-03-09,https://t.me/vaultofsecrets/11849,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Men are more likely to go to war and die. As a consequence, there is often a scarcity of males after conflicts. This shortage impacts economic variables through different channels. Several papers have evaluated these effects on developed countries – specifically, exploiting WWI and WWII and focusing on labour force participation, marriage markets, and out-of-wedlock births. Acemoglu et al. (2004) and Fernandez et al. (2004) find that after WWII female labour force participation increased permanently and suggest changes in gender norms as the mechanisms for higher participation. In this column, we focus instead on a conflict that took place in a developing country: The War of the Triple Alliance (1864-1870). This war generated one of the largest sex ratio shocks in history. https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/sex-ratios-and-conflict-evidence-paraguay",2023-03-09 12:37:54+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/21348,,,2849,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They invaded Saxony, too, and compelled Duke Henry to make a nine years truce with them, and to agree to pay them an annual tribute. The Saxons, who fought on foot, were unable to compete with a mounted enemy. They were accustomed to live in open villages with few places of refuge from invading horsemen. Henry mobilised one in nine men and ordered cities to be fortified and to supplied to hold out. Each fortification at convenient distance from the next. Henry began training his Saxons to fight on horseback and raised an efficient force of cavalry. His efficiency proved it's worth. At the expiration of the truce with the Hungarians they renewed their invasions, but this time Henry crushed them. He defeated the Slavs in the east, and many other tribes including the Bohemians, became tributary to him.

In it all numbers were written in letters. You could also see the Glagolitic system, but the principle was similar. The creator of the clock dial on the Spasskaya tower in 1624 was Christopher Galovay, an engineer from England. Already in 1628 after a fire, the clock had to be reconstructed. On the territory of present-day Russia, the Kremlin clocks were called ""Russian"" by residents of other countries. What appearance they had, at the time, caused bewilderment in many people. The dial in the mechanism was painted azure. It was a symbol of heaven. The top was painted in gold and silver in the form of the sun, stars, and moon. There were no arrows. They were replaced by a stationary arrow in the upper part - an imitation of a sunbeam. In this case, it was the dial that was moving.

msg_iteration.38131.user.Davidscave.post.21187,1620420179,Davidscave,21187,,"A personalized God can be a mere idol carved in our own image- a projection of our limited needs, fears, and desires. We can assume that he loves what we love and hates what we hate, endorsing our prejudices instead of compelling us to transcend them. When he seems to fail to prevent a catastrophe or seems even to desire a tragedy, he can seem callous and cruel. A facile belief that a disaster is the will of God can make us accept things that are fundamentally unacceptable. The very fact, as a person, God has a gender is also limiting: It means that the sexuality of half the human race is sacralized at the expense of the female and can lead to neurotic and inadequate imbalance in human sexual mores. A personal God can be dangerous, therefore. Instead of pulling us beyond our limitations, “he” can encourage us to remain complacently within them; “he” can make us cruel, callous, self-satisfied and partial as “he” seems to be. Instead of inspiring the compassion that should characterize all advanced religions, “he” can encourage us to judge, condemn, and marginalize. -Karen Armstrong-",2023-03-07 16:30:24+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/21187,,,477,2,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The myth symbolizes the struggle for political and individual freedom. The legend began seven hundred years ago when the Austrians controlled what is now Switzerland. The Austrian ruler, Landburgher Gessler, tyrannically demanded every passerby of the marketplace salute his hat, that hung on a pole. Tell, walking into the marketplace for the first time following the edict, refused to salute and was immediately arrested. Gessler, who knew of Tell's skill as a bowman, ordered that Tell's only hope of avoiding execution was to shoot an arrow into an apple placed on his son's head from a distance of 20 paces (approximately 60 feet). According to the legend, Tell successfully split the apple on his son's head and later killed Gessler and thus initiated the movement which secured Switzerland's independence. However, like most folklore, the story as well as Tell's own existence is open to dispute.",2023-03-07 16:29:13+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/21183,,,573,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[...] It has been called falsely a card of martyrdom, a card of prudence, a card of the Great Work, a card of duty [...] I will say very simply on my own part that it expresses the relation, in one of its aspects, between the Divine and the Universe.",2023-03-05 15:06:45+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/21050,,,477,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is used in game playing as well as in divination. It depicts a pittura infamante, an image of a man being hanged upside-down by one ankle (the only exception being the Tarocco Siciliano, which depicts the man hanged by the neck instead).This method of hanging was a common punishment at the time for traitors in Italy. However, the solemn expression on his face traditionally suggests that he is there by his own accord, and the card is meant to represent self-sacrifice more so than it does corporal punishment or criminality.",2023-03-05 15:06:45+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/21049,,,501,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What’s more, waging war in early 20th-century Arabia revolved around the same primal issues—where an army on the move might find water and forage for its animals—as the wars of 14th-century Europe that Lawrence had so thoroughly studied at Oxford. Very quickly, Faisal came to regard the young British officer as one of his most trusted advisers, as Lawrence, donning the robes of an Arab sheik, assumed a position of honor in tribal strategy sessions. With British naval help, the Arabs captured a succession of Turkish-held towns along the Red Sea coast, while Lawrence organized guerrilla raids against the inland Hejaz Railway. https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/true-story-lawrence-arabia-180951857/",2023-03-04 18:51:43+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/20976,,,464,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For instance, after running into the Order of Melchizedek in Paris and some of its splinter groups, he starts talking like any group prominently using Melchizedek in its imagery must have an organisational connection, when we’re talking about a Bible character who’s right there available for anyone to hang ancient aliens-type ideas on.",2023-03-04 01:48:57+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/20893,,,477,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His initial reason for doing so was a hypothesis that UFOs are a real physical phenomenon which has psychological or neurological effects on witnesses, and so by looking to said witnesses it might be possible to find evidence of this. However, Messengers of Deception is not a usual UFO book, and the investigations Vallée undertakes in the course of it are far from useless. For by turning his attention to the community of contactees and the sects that form around them, Vallée was perturbed to discover a number of recurring elements within the subculture – a certain authoritarianism, an embrace of the irrational and rejection of scientific consensus, a playing-down of the inventiveness and accomplishments of humanity in favour of submission to a higher power, and perhaps most disturbingly, a range of connections to reclusive occult traditions and extremist politics.",2023-03-04 01:48:45+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/20892,,,461,2,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the time of which reception, the story is, that, having ordered three chairs of state to be set, one for Ariobarzanes, one for Orobazus, and a third for himself, he placed himself in the middle, and so gave audience. For this the King of Parthia afterwards put Orobazus to death. Some people commended Sylla for his lofty carriage towards the barbarians; others again accused him of arrogance and unseasonable display. It is reported that a certain Chaldæan, of Orobazus’s retinue, looking Sylla wistfully in the face, and observing carefully the motions of his mind and body, and forming a judgment of his nature, according to the rules of his art, said that it was impossible for him not to become the greatest of men; it was rather a wonder how he could even then abstain from being head of all.""

Various adaptations of this practice survived to the modern western world over the ages. The art was based on observation of the way the basic elements as the ancients saw them (i.e. water element, earth element, etc.), lifestyle and even astrology (another Chaldæan art), affected the development of facial features. Each element observed to produce a certain geometric shapes, morphological type and specific temperament. The system of observing the external facial form, allowed an opinion to be passed on the person's temperament, character, mental faculties, and their mental state (in general). The Persian horoscope system was applied by some to show the influence of the 12 zodiac signs on the facial features. As with any art it was subject to over-analysis, however it addressed the basic need of people to understand other people.",2023-03-03 17:48:41+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/20848,,,382,0,9,1,PeerChannel,1497242922.0,vaultofsecrets,2023-03-03 17:47:40,2023-03-03,https://t.me/vaultofsecrets/11789,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Matter does not exist.” -Albert Einstein- This 3D reality is less than 1% of the electromagnetic spectrum and less than 1% of the acoustic spectrum. Our perception is to see everything as solid, three-dimensional, but atoms are 99.9999999999999999% empty space and the remaining 0.0000000000000001% cannot be perceived or measured as a solid. Color and matter are simply the brain's three-dimensional interpretation of light frequencies. It goes without saying that at least 90% of the matter in the universe is immeasurable and invisible (dark matter). “Remember how electric currents and invisible waves were mocked? Human knowledge is just beginning.” —Albert Einstein. “With the advent of quantum theory, it was discovered that even these very small subatomic particles are not solid. In fact, they bear no resemblance to matter. At least not with matter as we know it.” of potential existence with no definite location, and are mostly energy rather than particles.

Most notable was the eighteenth-century German philosopher Immanual Kant, who drew a clear distinction between the forms that appear in the mind–what he called the phenomenon (a Greek word meaning ""that which appears to be"")–and the world that gives rise to this perception, which he called the noumenon (meaning ""that which is apprehended""). All we know, Kant insisted, is the phenomenon. The noumenon, the ""thing-in-itself,"" remains forever beyond our knowing. As to the ultimate things we can know nothing, and only when we admit this do we return to equilibrium.

The tales are unabashedly Pagan and ancient, filled with timeless wisdom and the reality of the sometimes harsh...may we say ‘grim,’ nature of life. They are cautionary in that they show the monsters which appear to endanger the virtuous when shortcuts are tried and woeful ends for villains caught up in their own misdeeds. Virtues of honesty, hard work and humiliy are rewarded with the surety of a force of nature.

The modern study agreed: “Some of these stories go back much further than the earliest literary record & indeed further back than classical mythology – some versions appear in Latin & Greek texts – but our findings suggest they are much older still.” “We find it pretty remarkable these stories have survived without being written. They have been told since before even English, French & Italian existed. They were probably told in an extinct Indo-European language.” (source)",2023-03-02 18:06:42+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/20742,,,424,0,3,1,PeerChannel,1304219150.0,Aryologia,2019-08-22 15:21:10,2019-08-22,https://t.me/Aryologia/313,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s known that even the most ancient empires that we study such as the Akkadians and Sumerians around 23rd Century BC used helmets. As warfare and weapons evolved, so did the helmets used to protect against them. Helmets made from leather, evolved into brass, bronze, steel and then to the complex modern fibres of today. They also became a fancy instrument to use in parades and ceremonies after a while, which resulted in some interesting, maybe weird, designs as well.

Using a special type of soap, it's possible to remove all the cellular material from a piece of tissue, leaving only the connective proteins and polymers behind that normally hold the cells in place. It leaves you with something that looks like the starting material, but is really just an empty sponge called a scaffold. Doctors and scientists have been exploring this technique for many years because those empty scaffolds are extremely useful for cell culture. By seeding them with cells taken from a patient, it's possible to grow a brand new organ or tissue able to be transplanted into a patient, potentially saving their life. The same technique could even be used to make lab grown meat. Today we explore this amazing process and turn an ordinary grape, into meat.

Then the war ended and the troops went home, leaving just a few scraps behind. These populations, in a demonstration of Arthur C. Clarke’s third law which states “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”, concluded that such a windfall must have come from the gods. They wanted this wealth of cargo to return. So they did what seemed logical from their perspective: they set about to recreate the conditions under which the gods and their cargo had come. They cleared paths in the jungle to resemble airfields. They wore scraps of military uniforms. They made “rifles” out of bamboo and marched as they had seen the soldiers march. And always they kept their eye on the sky, hopeful that the gods observed their preparations and would soon return with more cargo.",2023-03-01 12:39:04+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/20618,,,514,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It states in particular: “Mustafa Kemal, reported by some to be of Salonika Jewish descent, only joined the Nationalist movement openly in June, 1919” (The Break-up of Turkey, The Times History of the War, vol. XXI, London, 1920, p. 433). Another well-known Western publication, the American Literary Digest, describes Mustafa Kemal in 1922 as “[a] Spanish Jew by ancestry, an orthodox Moslem by birth and breeding” (The Sort of Man Mustafa Kemal is, The Literary Digest, October 14, 1922, vol. 75, no. 2, pp. 50-53). The aforementioned do not reveal anything essentially new, but they merely give an indication of the numerous such statements made in the press at the time on Mustafa Kemal’s donmeh origins. Let us add one or two more. The Associated Press news agency, citing the Grand Vizier of Turkey, mentions in an item of the 3rd of July, 1920: “Mustafa Kemal, (the Turkish nationalist leader) whom the great vizier presents as a Jew, was born a Turk and his parents were from Saloniki and were Deonmes, that is converts, as were the parents of Talat (A noteworthy reference to Talaat’s donmeh origins is preserved in the marriage memoirs of the celebrated journalist Zekeriya Sertel (1890-1980). Describing how he had to overcome many difficulties in order to marry a donmeh, Sabiha Dervish, he writes, “At our engagement, the representative for the girl’s side was then-Prime Minister Talat Pasha”. Rifat N. Bali, A Scapegoat for All Seasons: The Donmes or Crypto-Jews of Turkey, Istanbul, 2008, p. 161) and Djavid” (Takes Issue with Turk’s Statement about Armenians, by the Associated Press, The Evening Progress, Saturday, July 3, 1920, p. 5).",2023-02-28 12:32:31+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/20580,,,605,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For many Turks, it marks the beginning of a process of national revival in which Mustafa Kemal (later Kemal Atatürk), the Ottoman hero of Gallipoli, would become the founding president of the Turkish Republic. Atatürk was born either in the Ahmet Subaşı neighbourhood or at a house (preserved as a museum) in Islahhane Street (now Apostolou Pavlou Street) in the Koca Kasım Pasha neighbourhood in Salonica (Selanik), Ottoman Empire (Thessaloniki in present-day Greece).",2023-02-28 12:31:55+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/20578,,,591,2,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New Zealand suffered around 8000 casualties, including 2779 dead. Australia’s 28,000 casualties included more than 8700 fatalities. The Ottomans paid a heavy price for their victory: an estimated 250,000 men were killed or wounded defending Gallipoli. For the survivors, their families and communities, the effects of the campaign would last for many years. Strategic factors determined the outcome of the campaign. Essentially, the Allies did not have enough men available at the crucial moments. Hamilton launched the campaign with five divisions against a roughly comparable Ottoman force operating on familiar territory. This rough parity continued throughout the campaign, with 13 Allied divisions eventually facing 14 Ottoman divisions. The British government’s lukewarm commitment to Gallipoli before July 1915 ensured that the Allied build-up was always too little, too late. Poor leadership also played a part in the Allied failure, with many men sacrificed in futile attacks at Anzac and Helles.",2023-02-28 12:31:12+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/20576,,,522,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of note, individuals who made felt hats displayed signs of dementia as a result of mercury poisoning. These “Mad Hatters” were referred to by Lewis Carroll in his book Alice in Wonderland. The phrase mad as a hatter is likely a reference to mercury poisoning among milliners (so-called ""mad hatter disease""). The Mad Hatter character of Alice in Wonderland was, it is presumed, inspired by an eccentric furniture dealer named Theophilus Carter. Carter was not a victim of mad hatter disease although Lewis Carroll would have been familiar with the phenomenon of dementia that occurred among hatters.",2023-02-27 13:47:48+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/20527,,,601,2,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Le Bon argues that, when people come together as a crowd, their individual intelligence and characters are compromised. Instead, they form a collective mind that makes them think and act. Crowd members acquire a feeling of invincibility that allows them to do things that they wouldn’t do if they are on their own. Crowds Are Easily Influenced Given that the crowd forms a singular mind, it can be easily influenced by suggestions. Le Bon believes that a crowd’s mind cannot differentiate the subjective from the objective, and is only capable of thinking in vivid images and simple yet extreme ideas. Secrets to Persuading the Crowd After explaining the psychology and motivation behind crowds, Le Bon provides three key characteristics for leaders of crowds. Affirmation: pure and simple messages that are free of reasoning and proof Repetition: incessant repetition of the affirmation makes the inconceivable eventually facts in the crowd’s mind Contagion: once affirmation message establishes its ground, the message will spread like a virus among the public",2023-02-27 13:30:46+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/20525,,,568,0,9,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When a group of people comes together and coalesces to form a crowd, there is a ""crowd-given magnetic influence"" that transmutes each individual's behavior until it is governed by the ""group mind."" This model treats the crowd as a unit in its composition that robs each individual member of their opinions, values ​​and beliefs; as Le Bon states, ""An individual in a crowd is a grain of sand among other grains of sand, which the wind stirs at will."" -Gustave Le Bon - The Crowd",2023-02-27 13:30:34+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/20524,,,557,0,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First-ever authorized reprint of Albert Pike’s first draft of the complete Scottish Rite rituals, from 4° Secret Master, through 32° Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret. In 1855 the Supreme Council appointed a committee of five persons to standardize the rituals of the Scottish Rite. At the time Pike was the only 32° member of the committee, yet he was the only one to complete his task. Working on the rituals for two years he had printed, at his own expense, 100 copies of the ritual, which Albert G. Mackey dubbed the “Magnum Opus” or Great Work. Although the work was never officially adopted, it was a major step forward, and the text served as the basis for subsequent revisions. This valuable work allows us to trace the development of Scottish Rite ritual and philosophy. The lectures, which follow each degree, became the foundation for Pike’s “Morals and Dogma.” This book influenced the development of the Scottish Rite’s rituals in almost every country of the world. The introduction includes a historical overview of the Scottish Rite’s ritual, and discuss the development from pre-1801 (John Mitchell’s rituals) through 1853 (Albert G. Mackey’s rituals). The introduction also discusses the condition of the early rituals, the early Scottish Rite in Louisiana, the Cerneau Grand Consistory/Council, the Supreme Council of Louisiana, the rival Grand Lodges and a new Consistory in New Orleans, the Concordat of 1855, the 1855 ritual committee, and more. Includes a complete facsimile of the original text, and a full plaintext decryption of the secret work. Illustrated. Includes an index by S.

The latter was the ideology of the Joseon Dynasty government; it supported the status quo; and was ineffective in stemming abuses by local officials and the spread of Catholicism. Su-un felt he was called to address the root cause of the ""dark age"" which he considered to be inner spiritual depletion and social corruption.

Starting with the ""Philadelphia Experiment""; of 1943, invisibility experiments were conducted aboard the USS Eldridge that resulted in full scale teleportation of the ship and crew. Forty years of massive research ensued, culminating in bizarre experiments at Montauk Point that actually tapped the powers of creation and manipulated time itself. The Montauk Project bridges the modalities of science with the most esoteric techniques ever imagined and finally catapults us to the threshold of the stars.

He wanted school boards of parents to have a choice of role models in their school and recourse to fire of any teacher who was found to be, “advocating, imposing, encouraging or promoting homosexual activity."" The oposition included not only homosexuals but received a rallying support from the Marxists of America who called for support against the ""rightwing Senator"". In 1978 the voters defeated the Proposition 6 initiative 58.4% to 41.6% across the state of California.

The book proposes that the Universe is a quantum computer (supercomputer), and advances in the understanding of physics may come from viewing entropy as a phenomenon of information, rather than simply thermodynamics. Lloyd also postulates that the Universe can be fully simulated using a quantum computer; however, in the absence of a theory of quantum gravity, such a simulation is not yet possible.

Inca have a form of non-verbal communication written in an encoded language similar to the binary code of today’s computers. Gary Urton, professor of anthropology at Harvard University, has re-analyzed the complicated knotted strings of the Inca -- decorative objects called khipu -- and found they contain a seven-bit binary code capable of conveying more than 1,500 separate units of information. The Khipu Database Project (KDP), begun by Gary Urton, may have already decoded the first word from a quipu—the name of a village, Puruchuco, which Urton believes was represented by a three-number sequence, similar to a ZIP code. Quipu are artifacts of the world’s first three dimensional written language, this is astonishingly sophisticated for a Bronze Age culture. Performing a number of statistical tests for quipu sample VA 42527 (Museum für Völkerkunde, Berlin) one study led by Alberto Sáez-Rodríguez discovered that the distribution and patterning of S- and Z-knots can organize the information system from a real star map in 2 dimensions of the pleiades star cluster.",2023-02-22 14:46:55+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/20130,,,528,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No! The human body has a gland behind the lungs known as the thymus.” However, the thymus is most active when the baby is in the womb. They remain active until puberty. Then, when it becomes less fertile, it starts to shrink and wither away. The mature thymus is encapsulated, cone-shaped, and formed by two fused lobes. Birth weight ranges from 10 to 35 g and continues to increase until puberty at age 15 (to this day, her increased fertility potential allows her to pass the rite of passage from girl to woman. However, when peak weight reaches 20-50g, from there progressive atrophy occurs. But typical growth rates in children and regression rates in adults are highly variable, making it difficult to determine an age-appropriate weight. Hakim Awyan continues: however the thymus and the uterus are connected throughout the life cycle. Anyway, looking at the double crown, the red crown is the uterus and placenta. The white crown is the thymus, which affects the uterus and ends with the words: ""This is a symbol of one of the glands.""

One of the most misunderstood functions of the human body today is the glands, or endocrine system. First, the gonads secrete hormones that trigger reproduction. Fertility and reproduction were of great importance in Egyptian ideology. The ancients knew the relationship between our glands and the subtle bodies, as ancient Hindu teachings speak of seven major energy centers in the energy body called chakras (wheels of light). Like the Hindus, the ancient Egyptians were aware of the similarities between the concept of chakras and our glands. However, the ancient Egyptians had a comprehensive understanding of the importance of the glands and their central role in reproduction and the unconscious.

msg_iteration.39298.user.Davidscave.post.19996,1620420179,Davidscave,19996,,"Bêl is a title signifying ""lord"" or ""master"" applied to various gods in the Mesopotamian religion of Akkad, Assyria, and Babylonia. The feminine form is Bêlit ('Lady, Mistress') in Akkadian. Bel is represented in Greek as Belos and in Latin as Belus. Belit appears in Greek form as Beltis, Bel is an East Semitic form cognate with the Northwest Semitic Baal with the same meaning. Bel was especially used for the Babylonian god Marduk in Assyrian and neo-Babylonian personal names or mentioned in inscriptions in a Mesopotamian context. Similarly, Bêlit mostly refers to Marduk's spouse Sarpanit. Marduk's mother, the Sumerian goddess often referred to in the Sumerian language as Ninhursag, Damkina, and Ninmah, was often known as Belit-ili (""Lady of the Gods"") in Akkadian. Other gods called ""Lord"" were sometimes identified totally or in part with Bel Marduk. The god Malak-bel of Palmyra is an example, attested as a messenger of Bel but existing as a deity separate to Bel/Marduk. Similarly, Zeus Belus mentioned by Sanchuniathon as born to Cronus/El in Peraea is unlikely to be Marduk. Early translators of Akkadian believed that the ideogram for the god called Enlil in Sumerian was to be read as Bel in Akkadian. Current scholarship holds this as incorrect, but Bel is used in referring to Enlil in older translations and discussions. In Mandaean cosmology, the name for Jupiter is Bil , which is derived from the name Bel.",2023-02-20 20:29:06+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/19996,,,548,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Greek historian Herodotus reports that Psamtik I was interested in discovering the oldest language, which the pharaoh believed could be none other than Egyptian. He concluded that placing two newborns in the care of shepherds (possibly deaf), who had been bound not to teach them how to speak, might show what manner of language would develop spontaneously. He allegedly discovered, after the children were presented a few years later and uttered a word that the observers believed was “bread,” that they spoke a form of Phrygian. This test, according to scholar Antoni Sulek, is often cited as the “first instance of using the experimental method in the study of social phenomena, and in psychology—as the prototype of research on the relative role of heredity and environment in the development.” Psamtik I ruled for fifty-four years and was succeeded by his son, Necho II (610-595 b.c.e.), who continued his father’s penchant for research by sending out expeditions of exploration.",2023-02-19 13:54:04+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/19893,,,529,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both the CIA and KGB devoted quantities of time and money to find ways in which psychic warfare could be carried out. In this fascinating assessment of this research, the experiments and programmes are described in detail, and this account of hitherto secret work reveals how it laid the foundation for even more sensational developments. Drawing on research from around the world, Dr Gruber explains how parapsychologists are bringing their work to the forefront of scientific research as the phenomena of extrasensory perception, like remote viewing, telepathy, clairvoyance and precognition, are subjected to rigorous research methods. Parapsychology can no longer be regarded as belonging to the fringes of science and Dr Gruber's thorough and persuasive arguments show that this is a science with a real and serious future.""",2023-02-19 09:44:30+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/19867,,,512,0,7,1,PeerChannel,1493976297.0,magickmatters,2022-01-31 01:08:20,2022-01-31,https://t.me/magickmatters/16143,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Actually it is the true story of Project STARGATE, the U.S. government's top secret program and the experiences of its former director. Tracks in the Psychic Wilderness is one man’s personal and professional journey into the realm of parapsychological phenomena. In 1975 Dale Graff was safely entrenched as an Aerospace Engineer and Physicist with the United States Air Force’s Foreign Technology Division. Little did he know that the result of one of his assessment reports on emerging technologies would be the beginning of the highly classified Project STARGATE—which lasted over 20 years—and, perhaps more importantly, would bring him in contact with his own new perspective of reality. In this riveting book Graff shares his fascinating experiences as the director of Project STARGATE and his personal odyssey following Tracks in the Psychic Wilderness.

In my study of communist societies, I came to the conclusion that the purpose of communist propaganda was not to persuade or convince, not to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the less it corresponded to reality the better. When people are forced to remain silent when they are being told the most obvious lies, or even worse when they are forced to repeat the lies themselves, they lose once and for all their sense of probity. To assent to obvious lies is in some small way to become evil oneself. One's standing to resist anything is thus eroded, and even destroyed. A society of emasculated liars is easy to control. I think if you examine political correctness, it has the same effect and is intended to.

It corresponds to the Western Christian Carnival, except that Orthodox Lent begins on a Monday instead of a Wednesday, and the Orthodox date of Easter can differ greatly from the Western Christian date. The traditional attributes of the Maslenitsa celebration are the Maslenitsa effigy, sleigh rides, festivities. Russians bake bliny and flatbread, while Belarusians and Ukrainians cook pierogi and syrniki. According to archeological evidence from 2nd century A.D.

Mathematically, this is 4 x 108 a connection to the hidden pattern in the Fibonacci Sequence and therefore creates a resonance to the Living Mathematics of Nature. 432 Hz is in resonance with the sun, with water, an ancient harmonically tuned instrument of the highest order. Tuning to 432 Hz creates intervals and tones that have beautiful and harmonic effects on the human being who is listening, very similar to Rudolf Steiner's suggested pitch that the world must set its tuning to C=256 Hz, giving the A note the value of 432 Hz. That is why it was called the ""Philosopher's C"" because it was a Celebration of Advanced Human Knowledge being in tune with the Cosmos, with Time and Space, with Shape and with particularly in resonance with the magnificent Rhombic TriaContahedron.

The clock displays not only Prague time, but also Celestial, Old Czech – Italian time, Central European and Babylonian time.

He was the student and nephew of the renowned Giovanni Antonio Canal Canaletto and sometimes used the latter's illustrious name, signing himself as Bernardo Canaletto. In Germany and Poland, Bellotto called himself by his uncle's name, Canaletto. This caused some confusion, however Bellotto’s work is more sombre in color than Canaletto's and his depiction of clouds and shadows brings him closer to Dutch painting. Bellotto's style was characterized by elaborate representation of architectural and natural vistas, and by the specific quality of each place's lighting. It is plausible that Bellotto, and other Venetian masters of vedute, may have used the camera obscura in order to achieve superior precision of urban views.",2023-02-15 20:11:53+00:00,https://t.me/Davidscave/19615,,,509,1,3,1,PeerChannel,1803001645.0,p005art,2023-02-15 20:10:46,2023-02-15,https://t.me/p005art/1068,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To improve his chances, the army introduced this one-man tank. The device is made to resemble a cannon which it is hoped will be considered by the enemy to be broken and discarded. It is provided with slits and larger openings through which the scout may see and get air. The wheels, though apparently rusty, are smooth-running and noiseless, and the legs of the scout, moving cautiously at the rate of perhaps one-half inch per minute during critical times, resemble the drooping muzzle of the gun — or it is hoped that they will. “It is also considered among the possibilities that the device will be of service when it is necessary for a bold and death-defying dash to be made through showers of shrapnel into the teeth of the foe.

Both looking back to the Olympic Planetary Spirits of the ancient Hellenistic Pagan World but also very modern for the time, embracing both Calvinism and the alchemic and magical ideas of Paracelsus. This grimoire, or magical handbook, also provides one of the most clear and beneficent forms of magic ever developed, marked by simple piety, streamlined ritual and one's ethical duty to God, Self & Neighbors. Indeed, virtually every magical handbook published after would, in some way, be influenced by it's magic: from Dr. John Dee's Enochian sessions, the early Rosicrucians & the African magical traditions of the Caribbean and North America.

msg_iteration.39748.user.Davidscave.post.19529,1620420179,Davidscave,19529,,"Decimation (Latin: decimatio; decem = ""ten"") was a form of Roman military discipline in which every tenth man in a group was executed by members of his cohort. The discipline was used by senior commanders in the Roman army to punish units or large groups guilty of capital offences, such as cowardice, mutiny, desertion, and insubordination, and for pacification of rebellious legions. The word decimation is derived from Latin meaning ""removal of a tenth"".

The Romans say that these mysterious and ancient curses have such power that no one involved in them ever escapes, and misfortune falls also upon the one who utters them, wherefore they are not employed at random nor by many. And accordingly at this time they found fault with Ateius because it was for the city's sake that he was angered at Crassus, and yet he had involved the city in curses which awakened much superstitious terror"" (Plutarch).

Power corrupts the few, while weakness corrupts the many. Hatred, malice, rudeness, intolerance, and suspicion are the fruits of weakness. The resentment of the weak does not spring from any injustice done to them but from the sense of their inadequacy and impotence. They hate not wickedness but weakness. When it is in their power to do so, the weak destroy weakness wherever they see it. Woe to the weak when they are preyed upon by the weak.

It reflects the gender politics of the day, with the man in charge and a warning about the kind of gal who doesn’t use antiseptic gum.

On his chest lay the love letter from his pregnant wife to the father of her unborn child. Below is the translation: ""To Won’s Father June 1, 1586 You always said, ‘Dear, let’s live together until our hair turns gray and die on the same day.’ How could you pass away without me? Who should I and our little boy listen to and how should we live? How could you go ahead of me? How did you bring your heart to me and how did I bring my heart to you? Whenever we lay down together you always told me, ‘Dear, do other people cherish and love each other like we do? Are they really like us?’ How could you leave all that behind and go ahead of me? I just cannot live without you. I just want to go to you. Please take me to where you are. My feelings toward you I cannot forget in this world and my sorrow knows no limit. Where would I put my heart in now and how can I live with the child missing you? Please look at this letter and tell me in detail in my dreams. Because I want to listen to your saying in detail in my dreams I write this letter and put it in. Look closely and talk to me. When I give birth to the child in me, who should it call father? Can anyone fathom how I feel? There is no tragedy like this under the sky. You are just in another place, and not in such a deep grief as I am. There is no limit and end to my sorrows that I write roughly. Please look closely at this letter and come to me in my dreams and show yourself in detail and tell me. I believe I can see you in my dreams. Come to me secretly and show yourself.
