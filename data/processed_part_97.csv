They might and should have made it the glory of all lands. But they have betrayed their trust: they have abused every gift: above all have they insulted him by flaunting in his face an impudent, atheistic, God-defying theory of pretended human rights and human perfectibility which attempts to deny man’s subordination, his dependence, his fall and native depravity, his need of divine grace. It invites mankind to adopt material civilization and sensual advantage as their divinity. It assumes to be able to perfect man’s condition by its political, literary, and mechanical skill, despising that Gospel of Christ which is man’s only adequate remedy. It crowns its impiety by laying its defiling hands upon the very forms of that Christianity, while with the mock affection of a Judas it attempts to make it a captive to the sordid ends of Mammon and sense."" - Robert Lewis Dabney This is what we are seeing now.",2022-10-04 14:53:20+00:00,https://t.me/kornbredscorner/1299,,,374,0,9,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heres the original: ""The philosophy of the Yankee mind is precisely that of the Yankee girl who, when she asked for leave to marry at seventeen, was dissuaded by her mother that she “had married very early and had seen the folly of it.” “Yes; but, Mamma,” replied the daughter, “I want to see the folly of it for myself.” Your Yankee philosopher is too self-sufficient to be cautioned from the past. He does not know history, he would not believe its conclusions if he did; he has no use for its lights, having enough “subjective” light of his own.

Yes, there are plenty of recorded sermons, conference messages, and lecture series. But we don’t have a lot of short explainer videos, especially when it comes to theology and history. So, about a year ago I started exploring what it would take to make a professional level explainer video for various topics and terms in systematic theology. I got a board together and started a ministry called Clearly Reformed. You may hear more about that in the weeks and months ahead. Initially the plan was to make a whole series of theological explainer videos. The good news: we got a great crew together to record a professional level video with teaching on the doctrine of divine simplicity. The bad news: it took a lot of time and a lot of money. The time and money aren’t anyone’s fault, that’s just what it takes to make a video like this. We tried one and learned what it takes. The upshot is that the “pilot episode” on divine simplicity is the only video we’ve made as Clearly Reformed. We have other ideas for the ministry and other ideas for the explainer concept. We are exploring more time efficient and cost-effective ways (e.g., a new podcast, a teaching series) to deliver the same sort of theological content. I am under contract with Crossway to do a book that will include 260 short chapters on theological terms and themes. So a book is definitely in the works, hopefully other complementary projects too. All that to say, we’ve had this video for several months now and haven’t been sure what to do with it. But whether we make another video like this or (more likely) go in a different direction, we thought one video was better than zero videos! So take a look, and if the video is helpful for you or your church, feel free to use it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are tangibly divorced from the traditions of the West. So much so, that shrink back from confronting outright demonic activity happening with our tax dollars and under the auspices of our names. We do this because we believe in ""freedom"". But, we are not free. We are bound by spells that silence us.

The beauty of our way of life is that you dont need the ivory tower to exist or know what you're doing. But being able to defend that way of life in the Ivory towers is important for a few reasons. First, the current academic sciences, the ones that have taken the reigns on the standards, informs how government writes policy. It sets the policy in opposition to our way of life. People with no connection to the land get to dictate how the land is treated or, when someone who does have connection to the land tries to make changes to policy, he has to fight the entire weight of academia and bureaucracy to make said change. Second, without leaders and bards who not only understand our way of life but can articulate it in academic terms, our people will not have the connection to the higher forms of expression. They remain simple in their ways and faith, and will be overshadowed and outspoken by others. My simple premise, as a response, is that Southern Academics should double down on their communities and try to ground the higher ideas in the work of the land.

Battlefield Burials at Malvern Hill,"In today's video, we're on the Malvern Hill Battlefield to see two pits that are thought to be the remnants of battlefield burials. The hail of solid shot, shell, and canister at Malvern Hill took it's toll upon the advancing Confederate troops of the Army of Northern Virginia. Many would be wounded or die during the assaults in the afternoon and evening of the 1st of July, 1862; prompting the survivors to do something about the remains of their former comrades as the fighting subsided and came to a close. Though Lee did not achieve his objective of dislodging the federal troops from Malvern Hill, the Army of the Potomac, under McClellan's orders, would continue their hasty withdraw towards their new supply depot along the banks of the James River, bringing an end to the first attempt to seize the City of Richmond and opening up the door for Lee to conduct his own offensive later in the year. __________ Today's video is going to be an exception from my usual upload. I had some free time this week and this video was something I was planning on making for a while. During my previous trip to the battlefield, I'd learn about and discovered the location of these battlefield burials. If you wish to visit the location, it's on the original trail of the Malvern Hill National Battlefield Park in the cluster of woods between Carter Mill Road and Willis Church Road. The site is best accessed from the Parsonage parking space, though I'd recommend starting from the Federal position and working your way towards the location to give you an impression of the commanding position the Army of the Potomac held that day. If you visit the site, remember to be respectful and do not trifle with the features. They, much like many of the breastworks and trenches at other sites throughout the Richmond National Battlefield Park chain, are fragile and can be damaged easily. __________ Links: https://www.nps.gov/rich/learn/historyculture/mhbull.htm https://www.nps.gov/rich/learn/historyculture/sevendays.htm",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The campaign paid Gab as a business for advertising during the primary. The campaign posts on Gab, as do 50+ other campaigns from around the country. That’s the extent of the relationship. My words are my own. My ideas are my own. They are not representative of Doug or Doug’s campaign. I stand by everything I have said about Christian Nationalism as a movement being an explicitly Christian. This should be obvious by the name. Others are certainly welcome to support the movement and enjoy the fruits of Christian leadership and culture, but we need candidates, leaders, thinkers, influencers, culture warriors, and builders who believe in and follow Jesus Christ. Otherwise it wouldn’t be Christian Nationalism. I stand with my brothers and sisters in Christ from all racial and ethnic backgrounds. If you are ethnically Jewish and call Jesus your Savior then you are my brother or sister. This isn’t a racial issue. It’s about defining the baseline for the social, political, and cultural movement of Christian Nationalism. We must be grounded in Biblical Truth and led by people who call Christ their King. When others see the fruit that yields, we pray that they too will come to know Jesus as their Savior. Either way, the path forward against secular liberal “democracy” and culture needs to be rooted in Christ and His followers.",2022-07-28 20:06:21+00:00,https://t.me/kornbredscorner/1046,,,216,0,1,1,PeerChannel,1155714507.0,gabtrends,2022-07-28 19:52:52,2022-07-28,https://t.me/gabtrends/7802,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I attempt to explain the broad strokes of a philosophy and worldview, paint contrasts between an 'is' and 'could be', and most importantly, encourage unconventional broad-picture thinking of the type we so need right this moment. I'd ask you to try to part with labels (republican, conservative, socialist, capitalist..) as you listen, and consider that most of these are antiquated, constraining, narrow and unhelpful.. and that ideal solutions might be found elsewhere. I've purposefully gone to some 'extremes', mentioning (without elaboration!) things like centrally planned economies or meritocratic councils of judges to help eliminate vices and guide the cultural development path, in an attempt to break away from current thought-forms and conceptions and encourage unconventional thinking on the broadest level. Things are moving very quickly now, with so many variables at play.. and though I do have a good feeling about the general 'inertia', I can't be certain what might occur in D.C. on the 6th, or 20th. For these reasons and others, I think speaking to specific solutions or paths forward is less valuable than finding core conceptions we might agree upon and rally around - and begin creating 'idea pathways' accordingly. The envisioning of new frameworks and fleshing out of such concepts takes time.. and the clock is ticking. To summarize the key points, I believe we need.. 1. ..true 'nations' - which aren't like hotels, airports, or shopping malls, but rather a *home* to a *family*: 'Philia' is key. 2. ..to simplify, and to learn to need and want *less*, with a renewed focus on what truly matters. 3. ..to studiously develop any new structure (political, economic, spiritual, philosophical) from the ground up with an eye towards staving off even the most creative attempts at subversion, parasitism, corruption foremost in mind. 4. ..to cultivate something of a new human type, an 'Overman' that bends the knee only to God - immune to petty temptations and distractions, fostering a relationship with the divine in their place - everywhere seeking to manifest greater strength, health, and beauty 5. ..to be willing to fight not merely to better our own lot, but that of others.. with a recognition that a failure here essentially guarantees the international domination of an enemy ideology/culture - which would then proceed to place us foremost in the crosshairs, with unlimited money and manpower at their disposal - making it both the right thing to do, and an absolute *necessity*. We may be nearing a point at which those that refuse to accept the worldview pushed by the media and their handlers will be 'locked out', accordingly.. economically, socially/culturally, politically. The 'virus' may be this trigger. The ideal preparation for this would be to reach a place where nothing is *needed* from this corrupt system and its willing collaborators, and to be in a position to help like-minds in similar positions around the world. We really do all have a role to play.. that role may be something as straightforward as raising and educating a healthy and well-oriented child, or being a true friend and support to others.. or it may be something more involved. I've always found it a helpful visual to imagine we form a collective body, with each individual acting as a different organ or limb. A body works best when all play their prescribed roles (and only their prescribed role) to the best of their ability. Lastly.. we had an excellent discussion regarding the creation of independent communities in our riot/Element community, which I regret missing out on. I recommend anyone interested in conversing or collaborating with like-minds considers joining us (www.element.io , create a free account and then email us the username at TPPAdmissions@protonmail.com).. and I'd like to reiterate: along with the goal of fostering friendships, alliances and social bonds, this environment is intended to be less a forum for me to lead and organize, and more a forum to cultivate leaders and organizers.

So, after burning sixty dollars on clamps, some wooden boards, and some epoxy (specifically one that would work with stonework), I went out and completed the task. It was both surprisingly easy and surprisingly stressful. Mixing the epoxy, spreading it on the base, getting the stone back in place, and clamping it down took all of ten minutes. However, during that whole time, I worried that I'd do far more damage to the stone. To my relief, it remained intact except for one piece, which I was able to slip back into place while the epoxy is holding it up well. On a side note, I want to mention here that the original repair work (something I mention briefly in the video) is a prime example of why you have to be careful to choose your bonding agents carefully. I couldn't remove the cement used in the original repair work without damaging the marble headstone. So, unfortunately, I had to leave most of it in place. I pray that John Pennington's headstone remains up for many years to come for all to see, to admire, and to mourn for the loss of the life of a young man from a terrible civil war. Private John W.

More than 12,000 reenactors and over 25,000 spectators attended the events spread over four days. In the words of one of those attending: ""The ball Saturday evening, hosted by the 2nd South Carolina String Band was the most high-energy and exciting ball I have yet attended. I arrived at the end, and was told to stay around afterwards for some ""ruckus."" The 2nd South Carolina broke out into, arguably, the most catchy song ever: ""Southern Soldier."" After every verse, the Rebel Yell screamed louder and louder, to a volume I have never heard even on a battlefield up to that point; it truly made the hair stand straight and the shine shiver. It was simply impossible to prevent oneself from joining in, whether Yankee or Rebel. And for the finale, the 2nd SC led the audience in ""Dixie."" I have never heard the song played and sung by so many people with so much energy. I've always loved both songs, but for the rest of my life, ""Southern Soldier"" and ""Dixie"" will continue to give me goosebumps as never before in remembrance of that dance. FrazierC 1st Sgt. 'The 150th Anniversary GAC Gettysburg Reenactment' www.civilwartalk.com This work was created by the 2nd South Carolina String Band in grateful appreciation to all of our friends and fans who have been so kind and supportive over more than 25 years, and as a tribute to all who fought for their cause 150 years ago.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So, after burning sixty dollars on clamps, some wooden boards, and some epoxy (specifically one that would work with stonework), I went out and completed the task. It was both surprisingly easy and surprisingly stressful. Mixing the epoxy, spreading it on the base, getting the stone back in place, and clamping it down took all of ten minutes. However, during that whole time, I worried that I'd do far more damage to the stone. To my relief, it remained intact except for one piece, which I was able to slip back into place while the epoxy is holding it up well. On a side note, I want to mention here that the original repair work (something I mention briefly in the video) is a prime example of why you have to be careful to choose your bonding agents carefully. I couldn't remove the cement used in the original repair work without damaging the marble headstone. So, unfortunately, I had to leave most of it in place. I pray that John Pennington's headstone remains up for many years to come for all to see, to admire, and to mourn for the loss of the life of a young man from a terrible civil war. Private John W.

He's done everything right, but he anticipates being badly outnumbered. Unlike many northern generals Burford is a regular army man and an Indian fighter. He has somewhere north of 3,000 effectives armed with repeating rifles, but the necessity of watching in three directions for converging Confederate columns gives him around 2100 men to face what he believes at this time to be around ten thousand men of Ewell's corps. He knows they're coming. On the other hand, Harry Heth has set himself up for a bad day. His leading colum under the command of William Pegram is *artillery*, followed closely by a brigade of Virginia natives and a mixed brigade of Mississippi and Louisiana infantry. Some time after dawn, these elements come under withering fire from Buford's cavalry as they move along the Chambersburg Pike.

Its leading elements under General Harry Heth went into bivouac early and asked for orders concerning the next day. He was given wide latitude to plan his own route, and given the choice between two routes that vaguely converged on the rally point for the whole army to make a move towards Harrisburg, he made a decision to take what scouts had told him was the shorter, better road. Federal cavalry had been spotted in the area during the day-- a worrying sign that the Army of the Potomac was not as far away as it was believed to be, but the southern route seemed safer, and offered a better gambit for the concentration of a second corps if trouble arose.

Architects, writers and composers produce works which are neither kitsch nor ‘kitsch’. Prayer and penitence have been interrupted, but not forgotten. To those who wish for it, the ethical life may still be retrieved. Ours is a catacomb culture, a flame kept alive by undaunted monks. And what the monks of Europe achieved in a former dark age, they might achieve again.” ~Sir Roger Scruton IMPERIVM",2022-06-19 21:04:02+00:00,https://t.me/kornbredscorner/833,,,179,0,3,1,PeerChannel,1391578486.0,ImperivmRenaissance,2022-06-09 03:26:49,2022-06-09,https://t.me/ImperivmRenaissance/9163,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.2768.user.kornbredscorner.post.775,1357939367,kornbredscorner,775,,"Admin 2 here: I just finished Matt Walsh's documentary ""What Is A Woman?"". As an up-front, unqualified position, I love it and it ought to be shared everywhere. I do take issue with his definition. Woman is not an ""Adult Human Female"". To be clear here, Walsh knows better. He is an intelligent Roman Catholic who, from all indications I have seen, know his Church's teachings on men and women. His definition is decidedly naturalistic and Godless. He stresses over and over, and even agrees with Dr Phil's characterization of a woman's identity being rooted in biology. He knows better but doesn't advocate for a real definition. This isn't a matter of pedantry for me, despite how this might be taken. The Scriptures are very clear about what a woman is (Gen2:18; 1Cor11:7,9; Eph5:29-32). There are two genders, man and woman. They were each made for a purpose--that is, they each have a telos. A woman is, not what her biology is, but what she was made for, and what her biology, psychology, and spirit confess to by their very existence. A woman is a human made to model femininity. She was made to model the Church who submits to Christ. She was made to model growth, nurture, possibility, and beauty. She was made to bring forth life and be the Glory of man. Womanhood is grounded in those things, not in biology. A woman's biology is only one expression of that Telos. To reduce womanhood to that is to fall into the same naturalist mindset we want to be rid of.",2022-06-08 01:33:48+00:00,https://t.me/kornbredscorner/775,,,1139,0,17,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such thinking will never lead to a perfect society. Utopia will have to wait. In the words of James Henley Thornwell “[It is when] we are prone to feel ourselves at home in this world when things go smoothly, that the Lord finds it necessary to cross us and disappoint us, in order that we may know that this is not our rest.” The Christian as well as the true Southerner knows that there is only one source of rest on this earth, and it is not to be found in the material, but in the spiritual. As the Master of all has told us, it is those who find their faith, not in government or social organization that truly find peace, but those who flee to Him. “Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.” It is in the authority of these words, and those that come before and after them, that Southerners found their sacred conviction. May these words be true for you as well. -Joseph Jay, Sacred Conviction: Conclusion",2022-05-26 13:29:07+00:00,https://t.me/kornbredscorner/715,,,197,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before too long most patrons of the establishment are laughing and carrying on. I'm telling my tall tales, the rum & brandy is flowing, and lass with a voice of a goddess is singing her magical tunes.

He apparently had a men's self improvement forum or something. This particular aspect piqued my interest because I think solid men's groups are needed, my evidence for this is the fact that men spent a large sum of money for an improvement group that turned out to be mostly a chat room men acting like boys. From my cursory research it seems to be more pick up artist type crap and less about being a good husband and father. Men need fraternities, men need other men to work out with, shoot guns with, hunt with, pray with. This doesn't happen behind a phone screen. I think the medium of electronic communication is great, but it can't stop there. We need local groups to form all throughout the south, small localized brotherhood. Localizing allows a more intimate vetting process and we can call others out on their shit. When it's not localized its easier for the degenerates to slip in unnoticed. I'm not saying perfection but I am saying men of good character.

No they never did defeat us, but we never could evade, Their dirty foreign politics, and cowardly blockade. Well we hadn’t any powder, and we hadn’t any shot, And we hadn’t any money to buy what we ain’t got. So we rode our worn-out horses, and we ate on plain cornmeal, And we licked em where we caught em, with Southern guts and steel. We sunk the ship at Sumter, and we broke her plumb in two. We showed them bully Yankees, just what we aimed to do. At a little creek called Bull Run, we took their starry rag, To wipe our horses down with, and I ain’t here to brag. Well there aren’t as many left of us as rode out at the start, And then there are the weary, weak, and body sad of heart. We fought a fight to tell about and I am here to say, I’d climb my horse and follow Marse to hell come any day.”",2021-12-14 19:34:54+00:00,https://t.me/kornbredscorner/357,,,91,0,6,1,PeerChannel,1422276980.0,VirginiaFlaggers,2021-12-14 19:01:30,2021-12-14,https://t.me/VirginiaFlaggers/468,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,video/mp4,5.028622704580756e+18,108.0,IMG_0643.MP4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now young man started talkin', made it plain to folks around He was there to stop the mob from burnin' businesses to ground. Didn't look like much the tough guy 'cept for one important thing, And that thing, of course, an AR riding tautly on a sling Tautly on a sling Now the night was passing quickly as the mob moved wielding flame And the youth called out to halt them when they spotted him as game He was running down the pavement when a lout caused him to trip And tempted the soi leader with the skateboard on his hip Skateboard on his hip It was over in a moment as the folks had gathered round, The skater sought the rifle as the youth lay on the ground, Oh he might have went on livin' but forgot one major thing And he fell down shot dead by the kid with AR on a sling AR on a sling A RRR A RRR He fell down shot dead by the kid with AR on a sling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Check out ""European Brain Snakes: Postmodernism as a Species"" today! https://canonpress.com/products/european-brain-snakes/ ""What actually happened was that our liberties were bequeathed to us by practitioners of a robust Christian faith, which had permeated our culture, but which gradually compromised with secularism, such that our culture then became self-consciously secular. And as soon as that happened, our liberties started disappearing. In some places, they disappeared faster than in other places, but enough about Australia. If you believe that what is happening in Australia isn’t their desired outcome for every place, as soon as practically possible, then you don’t understand a single thing that has happened in the last two years.

In some ways, Southerns have owned this outcast status and taken the detrimental elements with that. It is never too late to change that. Most Southerns I know aren't stupid, but they don't know their own history, and don't honor their people. Become educated. Don't settle for being the bumkin of the Yankee fantasy.

As he is virtuous or vicious, he decides for them whether they shall bear an honored name, or be branded with the mark of infamy at their outset in society. As he is pure and courteous, or coarse and sensual, he assigns to his children a social grade credible and elevated, giving them a passport to good society, or he condemns them to the association of the vulgar and low. His neglect of their early mental culture determines whether they shall reach adult life stupid boors or educated and intelligent men.

Harmony Grove Cemetery was selected because two of those murder victims, killed on the same day, are buried within feet of each other and are among the few listed civilians who were killed who actually have headstones.",2024-05-29 17:36:23+00:00,https://t.me/VirginiaFlaggers/2633,,,392,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Grant orchestrated a campaign to crush the Independent South by exploiting the Union army’s numerical superiority with simultaneous assaults on Georgia, Louisiana, and Virginia below Richmond. In the Shenandoah Valley, revered as the ""Breadbasket of the Confederacy” for its ability to produce food for the Confederacy, Union General Franz Sigel, a failed German revolutionary with ties to Marx and Engels, led over 10,000 troops to seize Staunton and Lynchburg, aiming to cripple the South's agricultural production and supply lines. Sigel's appointment as Major General by Lincoln, likely for political reasons, underscores the influx of far left European radicals into the Union ranks. By that time, many hundreds of thousands of failed far left revolutionaries from Germany had immigrated to the United States, and they became instrumental to Lincoln’s election. Lincoln even purchased a German language newspaper in Illinois to assist him politically. As a revolutionary leader in Germany. Franz Sigel was also very useful in recruiting many German immigrants to the US army for the war, many of whom were Marxists. By the end of the war they were a significant percentage of the total US army fighting to deny the South independence and they were willing to do so by any means necessary in a foreign land they didn’t care for. It is reported that many of these far left foreign mercenaries were responsible for many of the war crimes and human rights violations committed against Southern civilians in the Shenandoah Valley and other areas, engaging in rape, looting and the burning of homes and destruction of farms and livestock. To counter this criminal onslaught, General Robert E. Lee entrusted General John C. Breckinridge, a former Vice President and Lincoln's electoral rival, to rally Southern resistance across a vast swath of territory encompassing the Shenandoah Valley and parts of West Virginia. Breckinridge had at his disposal a scattered and under-resourced force consisting of veteran infantry regiments (too few), partisan cavalry units (effective but loosely organized), and native militia and home-guard units (poorly armed and of questionable reliability, many of them young boys and old men), numbering fewer than 5,000. Even the young cadets of the Virginia Military Institute joined the fray in defense of their homeland. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, these Southern heroes stood firm to protect their homes and Southern Independence from Union terrorism. On May 15, they met Sigel's forces at New Market, where against all odds, they emerged triumphant, sending a resounding message of defiance against tyranny and oppression, and causing Franz Sigel to lapse in and out of German in confusion as his veteran soldiers and mercenaries retreated after facing combat with the young Southern boys of the Shenandoah Valley",2024-05-15 22:47:13+00:00,https://t.me/VirginiaFlaggers/2596,,,554,0,9,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He had under his control twenty six States, most of which were more populous than the Southern States, and several Territories, and a steady flow of emigration from all Europe, — yes, from all the civilized world. He was President of a rich and well-organized government He had the United States Treasury, the Army and Navy, and was in possession of all the fortificatious, both North and South. On the other hand, President Davis, the chosen leader of the 11 Southern States, which composed the Confederacy, without money, without an army, without a fleet, without arms, organized a government, and maintained it in the face of all these odds and disadvantages for over four years. Had the conditions been reversed, what would what would have been the result? Jefferson Davis was, without doubt, one of the greatest men America has ever produced. The number of troops enlisted in the Confederate States during the war was about 600,000. North Carolina furnished over 150,000. She surrendered at Appomattox, more than twice as many muskets as did any other State, and at Greensboro more of her soldiers were among the paroled, than from any of her sister states. When we took the oath of allegiance to support the constitution and laws of the United States at Greensboro, we meant to comply with every condition therein contained. The Southern soldiers returned to their wasted homes and without a parallel, became law-abiding citizens, expecting of course, the protection of the government. But alas! That awful period of Carpet Bag rule, and Reconstruction followed, which for a few years seemed more desperate and aggravating if possible, than the horrors of war. Many of the best men of the State were disfranchised, and some imprisoned. W. W. Holden became Gov. and acted the traitor its no other North Carolinian ever did. He held within his grasp the power to administer justice, and help to raise and defend a helpless and down-trodden people; but instead, he did all in his power to heap reproach aud injustice upon the people of his native State. When impeached, tried and found guilty of his treasonable and unlawful acts, his pretended friends failed to come to his relief.

There your great-grandfather De Saussure, who was an old man, had fled from his home in Charleston with his five daughters. In a few days news was brought us that Cheraw had been burned, and everybody was starving. I was naturally eager to go to the assistance of my husband's people, and I went to one of my sisters-in-law asking her if she would be willing to accompany me to Cheraw, a drive of forty miles. She said she would go with me… We borrowed a pair of mules and started in the early morning with com meal and bacon and flour for my husband's people. We had driven only a few miles when we came to the road passed over by Sherman only four days before. Such sights as we beheld along that road; dead horses, disemboweled cattle, dead dogs, and as it was in spring they were all decomposed because of our hot climate. At every turn of the road we expected to meet outriders from the Northern army. It was a day of great fatigue and fear. We crossed and reached the town of Cheraw at ten o'clock at night. A scene of desolation greeted my eyes the next morning; all the public buildings had been burned, houses alone were standing amid desolate surroundings. The De Saussure family and others had been living on scorched rice and corn, scraped from the ashes. Officers as well as soldiers had gone Into houses and taken all food that could be found and burned It In the yards of the various houses; leaving the women and children to starve. My beautiful harp, which after cutting the strings, I had sent to Cheraw for safety In care of Mr. De Saussure, had narrowly escaped being taken by some officers. They asked to have the box opened for them, but Mr. De Saussure told them the harp was out of order, so they passed It by. My harp was safe, but your great-aunt Agnes was not so fortunate with her piano. It was a gift from her father when she left school, and a beautiful Steinway. When she married Colonel Colcock, he said to her: ""Ship your piano to Charleston; it will be safer there than in the country."" Colonel Colcock was from Charleston and had relatives to whom he wrote asking them to care for the piano, when it arrived. It reached Charleston just about the time the city fell into the hands of the enemy. Colonel Colcock's uncle went down to the station to get it, when he learned that an officer had taken it and shipped it off to the North.” — Mrs. Nancy B.

They were not thinking of their slaves when they cast all in the balance--their lives, their fortunes, their sacred honor-- and went forth to endure the hardships of the camp and the march and the perils of the battle field. They did not suffer, they did not fight, they did not die, for the privilege of holding their fellow men in bondage! No, it was for the sacred right of self-government that they fought. It was in defence of their homes and their firesides. It was to repel the invader, to resist a war of subjugation. It was in vindication of the principle enunciated in the Declaration of Independence that ""governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed."" Only a very small minority of the men who fought in the Southern armies — not one in ten — were financially interested in the institution of slavery. We cared little or nothing about it. To establish our independence we would at any time have gladly surrendered it. If any three men may be supposed to have known the object for which the war was waged, they were these: Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson Davis, and Robert E. Lee. Their decision agrees with what I have stated. Mr. Lincoln consistently held and declared that the object of the war was the restoration of the Union, not the emancipation of the slaves. Mr. Davis as positively declared that the South was fighting, for independence, not for slavery. And Robert E. Lee expressed his opinion by setting all his slaves free Jan. 8, 1863, and then going on with the war for more than two years longer. In February, 1861, Mr. Davis wrote to his wife in these words, ""In any case our slave property will eventually be lost."" Thus the political head of the Confederacy entered on the war foreseeing the eventual loss of his slaves, and the military head of the Confederacy actually set his slaves free before the war was half over. Yet both, they say, were fighting for slavery!” — Confederate 1st Lieutenant Randolph Harrison McKim, A Soldier’s Recollections (1910)",2024-04-17 21:12:18+00:00,https://t.me/VirginiaFlaggers/2496,,,436,1,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msg_iteration.285.user.VirginiaFlaggers.post.2495,1422276980,VirginiaFlaggers,2495,,"“And now I turn to the consideration of a grievous reproach often directed against the men who fought in the armies of the South in the Civil War. When we claim for them the crown of patriotism, when we aver that they drew their swords in what they believed to be the cause of liberty and self-government, it is answered that the corner-stone of the Southern Confederacy was slavery, and that the soldiers who fought under the banner of the Southern Cross were fighting for the perpetuation of the institution of slavery. That is a statement which I wish to repudiate with all the earnestness of which I am capable. It does a grievous injustice to half a million patriot soldiers who were animated by as pure a love of liberty as ever throbbed in the bosom of man, and who made as splendid an exhibition of self-sacrifice on her behalf as any soldiers who ever fought on any field since history began. In the first place, I ask, If slavery was the corner-stone of the Southern Confederacy, what are we to say of the Constitution of the United States? That instrument, as originally adopted by the thirteen colonies contained three sections which recognized slavery. (Art. 1, Sec. 2 and 9, and Art. 4, Sec. 2.) And whereas the Constitution of the Southern Confederacy prohibited the slave trade, the Constitution of the United States prohibited the abolition of the slave trade for twenty years (1789-1808)! And if the men of the South are reproached for denying liberty to three and a half million of human beings, at the same time that they professed to be waging a great war for their own liberty, what are we to say of the revolting colonies of 1776 who rebelled against the British crown to achieve their liberty while slavery existed in every one of the thirteen colonies undisturbed? Can not those historians who deny that the South fought for liberty, because they held the blacks in bondage, see that upon the same principal they must impugn the sincerity of the signers of the Declaration of Independence? We ask the candid historian to answer this question: If the colonists of 1776 were freeman fighting for liberty, though holding the blacks in slavery in every one of the thirteen colonies, why is the title of soldiers of liberty denied the Southern men of 1861, because they too held the blacks in bondage? Slavery was an inheritance which the people of the South received from the fathers, and if the States of the North, within fifty years of the Revolution, abolished the institution, it cannot be claimed that the abolition was dictated by moral considerations, but by differences of climate, soil, and industrial interests.” — Confederate 1st Lieutenant Randolph Harrison McKim, A Soldier’s Recollections (1910)",2024-04-17 21:07:49+00:00,https://t.me/VirginiaFlaggers/2495,,,419,0,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the War for Southern Independence broke out in 1861, his father and his two older brothers, Custis and Rooney, all chose to serve Virginia in the Confederate Army. To his mother's dismay, Rob joined them in 1862, enlisting in the Rockbridge Artillery as a private. During the Battle of Sharpsburg in September 1862, young Robert watched his father ride up to his artillery battery, which had already been heavily engaged. Junior stood by expecting to hear a few words of affection from his father, but Lee did not recognize his own son, hidden by the grime of black powder on his face. When Junior finally spoke up to ask if they would be thrown back into the fight, the general recognized him by his voice. ""Yes, my son.

Over a thousand miles from their homes, the Confederate soldiers of Hood’s Texas Brigade would suffer the second-highest casualty rate of any unit during the Civil War. On the morning of September 17, the men of the First, Fourth, and Fifth Texas Infantry regiments were held in reserve and attempting to cook breakfast as the fighting opened. They arrived in the hamlet of Sharpsburg, Maryland at the end of several months of hard campaigning in Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia. Assigned to duty in Virginia early in the war, the Texans earned a reputation for hard fighting after battles at Seven Pines, the Seven Days battles, and the second battle of Manassas. Lee affectionately referred to the men of Hood’s Brigade as “my Texans.” The Texan’s breakfast was abruptly interrupted when the Federal army launched an assault on the Confederate left flank. Hood’s Brigade fell into formation and marched north, passing wounded and frightened Confederates streaming to the rear. Emerging from the woods in the vicinity of the Dunker Church, the Texans were ordered forward in a counterattack. The Lone Star soldiers launched a ferocious assault through the cornfield, driving Federal units before them. The attack eventually foundered in the face of intense artillery and musket fire. The Texans stubbornly attempted to move forward, but massive casualties decimated their ranks. Eventually Hood’s Brigade was forced to withdraw under heavy fire. When the Texas Brigade regrouped and counted their losses, it was determined that over 550 of the brigade’s 850 soldiers had been killed, wounded, or captured. Through their gallant sacrifice, the Federal attack had been stopped, saving Lee’s Army.",2024-01-27 20:32:28+00:00,https://t.me/VirginiaFlaggers/2321,,,698,0,9,1,PeerChannel,1310984791.0,intelslava,2024-01-26 01:52:45,2024-01-26,https://t.me/intelslava/54976,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The song was published in 1847 by Lee & Walker of Philadelphia, PA. and became a national hit. After the Battle of Sharpsburg, MD (Antietam) General Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia started to return across the Potomac River to Virginia. As some of their ambulances entered the river, they came under Federal artillery fire. The teamsters panicked, cut their horses loose and escaped across the river, leaving their ambulance wagons in the river with the wounded still inside. Acting Brigadier General Colonel James Lane and his North Carolinians were members of Lee’s rear guard. When they came upon the stranded ambulances, Col. Lane spurred his soldiers into action. As some of the men dragged, pushed and pulled the ambulances to the safety of Virginia, others urged them on by singing “De Floating Scow of Old Virginia.” Their swift and decisive action saved the wounded and prevented them from becoming prisoners of war. They were carried back to safety of “Old Virginia’s Shore.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And as these first elements became homogeneous to the soil, the generations which followed, agglomerated and harmonized themselves with each several original nucleus. Hence in the South, Northern stock got elevated and purified, and in the North, Southern blood became corrupt and degenerated. In less than a quarter of a Century, the North hated the South and the South despised the North. The Chivalric valor of Southerners, whilst sitting in Congress in inferior numbers, secured to them at least outward marks of respect and in a conflict between a Southerner and a Northerner, the Northerner often basely cowed and even submitted to personal chastisement.

We could not feel gloomy when we saw his old gray head uncovered as he would pass us on the march, or be with us in a fight. I care not how weary or hungry we were, when we saw him we gave that Rebel yell, and hunger and wounds would be forgotten.",2023-07-14 18:42:58+00:00,https://t.me/VirginiaFlaggers/2024,,,1072,2,16,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sculptor Charles Keck created the statue of Jackson and his horse ""Little Sorrel""; they sit atop a marble pedestal facing south. The statue cost roughly $35,000 and was designed for a small city park donated by local civic philanthropist Paul Goodloe McIntire. (McIntire deeded the land to the city on the condition that the park would bear no other statue other than the one dedicated to Stonewall Jackson.) The inaugural ceremony took place during a Confederate reunion, and Jackson's great-great-granddaughter, Anna Jackson Preston, was there to unveil the statue.

With particular force does this apply to the civil war in America of 1861-1865. Had the North and the South regarded in anything like a similar light the long chain of events that preceded and led up to the war between the States, the war would never have been fought. Radical differences had grown up between the sections, and from the Northern point of view the circumstances and surroundings influencing the South were not clearly seen- or, if seen, were ignored. Either being true, how can the Northern writer tell the story impartially? History must have the truth set down. Generations of teaching by the fathers of the government, who had formed and administered the supreme law, had imbued the people of the South with firmly fixed views that were not to be shaken by newly grown theories of a section which by intrinsic changes had become hostile to much of what had been taught by the framers of the original constitution of the United States. The leaders of the Southern people represented the strength of the beliefs handed down by the fathers of the government, and they could not see unmoved the changes sought to be engrafted upon a constitution they had so long held sacred. The high principles that actuated them, the sincerity of their beliefs, and their unfaltering devotion to the Constitution as they understood it — and they did understand it — were neither known nor appreciated by those who so bitterly opposed them. It is for this reason that the time has not vet come when a history of the War Between the States can be written from the victor's viewpoint that will be just, or that can show the motives by which the people of the South were dominated.” — Dr. Robert Ambrose Halley, 1905",2023-01-08 17:30:21+00:00,https://t.me/VirginiaFlaggers/1565,,,475,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They come with a trampling army, Invading our native sod — Stand Southrons, fight and conquer! In the name of the mighty God! They are singing our song of triumph, Which was made to make us free, While they are breaking away the heart-strings Of our nation's harmony. Sadly it floateth from us, Sighing o'er land and wave, 'Till mute on the lips of the poet; It sleeps in his Southern grave. Spirit and song! departed! Minstrel and minstrelsy! We mourn thee heavy hearted! But we will, we shall be free! They are waving our flag above us, With the despot's tyrant will, With our blood they have stained its colors, And call it holy still. With tearful eyes, but steady hand, We'll tear its stripes apart, And fling them like broken fetters, That may not bind the heart — But we'll save our stars of glory, In the might of the sacred sign Of Him! who has fixed forever Our ""Southern Cross"" to shine. Stand Southrons, fight and conquer! Solemn and strong and sure! The fight shall not be longer Than God shall bid endure. By the life that only yesterday Waked with the infant's breath! By the feet which e'er the morn may Tread to the soldier's death! By the blood which cries to heaven! Crimson upon our sod! Stand Southrons, fight and conquer In the name of the mighty God!",2022-12-27 11:22:34+00:00,https://t.me/VirginiaFlaggers/1500,,,566,2,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bagby was a strong advocate for Southern Independence and was forced to flee to Danville on the same train as President Davis during the fall of Richmond in 1865. “He scarcely ever penned a line that was not inspired by his love of Virginia and his appreciation of the life lived within her borders. Nearly all he wrote was of Virginia, pure and simple.

It is my privilege to invite you once more to His footstool, not now in the garb of fasting and sorrow, but with joy and gladness, to render thanks for the great mercies received at His hand. A few months since, and our enemies poured forth their invading legions upon our soil. They laid waste our fields, polluted our altars and violated the sanctity of our homes. Around our capital they gathered their forces, and with boastful threats, claimed it as already their prize. The brave troops which rallied to its defense have extinguished these vain hopes, and, under the guidance of the same almighty hand, have scattered our enemies and driven them back in dismay. Uniting these defeated forces and the various armies which had been ravaging our coasts with the army of invasion in Northern Virginia, our enemies have renewed their attempt to subjugate us at the very place where their first effort was defeated, and the vengeance of retributive justice has overtaken the entire host in a second and complete overthrow. To this signal success accorded to our arms in the East has been graciously added another equally brilliant in the West. On the very day on which our forces were led to victory on the Plains of Manassas, in Virginia, the same Almighty arm assisted us to overcome our enemies at Richmond, in Kentucky. Thus, at one and the same time, have two great hostile armies been stricken down, and the wicked designs of their armies been set at naught. In such circumstances, it is meet and right that, as a people, we should bow down in adoring thankfulness to that gracious God who has been our bulwark and defense, and to offer unto him the tribute of thanksgiving and praise. In his hand is the issue of all events, and to him should we, in an especial manner, ascribe the honor of this great deliverance. Now, therefore, I, Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States, do issue this, my proclamation, setting apart Thursday, the 18th day of September inst., as a day of prayer and thanksgiving to Almighty God for the great mercies vouchsafed to our people, and more especially for the triumph of our arms at Richmond and Manassas; and I do hereby invite the people of the Confederate States to meet on that day at their respective places of public worship, and to unite in rendering thanks and praise to God for these great mercies, and to implore Him to conduct our country safely through the perils which surround us, to the final attainment of the blessings of peace and security.

José Quintero, enviado por el presidente confederado Jefferson Davis, fracasó en su intento de conseguir el apoyo de Juárez, pero ganó un amigo y aliado en la entonces creciente ciudad de Monterrey: Santiago Vidaurri. Vidaurri, encantado con la causa confederada, habló por su nación Nuevo León y aseguró que por la frontera de Coahuila, Nuevo León y Tamaulipas no marcharían tropas de Lincoln, y además proveería a los confederados con materia prima para la guerra, desde metales y herramientas hasta alimentos y ropa, a cambio de dinero y algodón sureño que entraría sobre todo por el puerto Bagdad en Tamaulipas. Vidaurri por su parte propuso a Quintero lo impensable: que a la Confederación se anexaran Tamaulipas y el estado de Nuevo León y Coahuila. El argumento de Santiago Vidaurri era que esta región era más cercana a Texas y los demás estados del sur que lo que nunca estaría de la Ciudad de México. El presidente Davis decidió no aceptar la propuesta de su aliado neoleonés pues habría significado una guerra contra México que no podría haber sostenido al mismo tiempo que le daba batalla a Lincoln. Aún así, y para disgusto de Benito Juárez, la alianza entre Jefferson Davis y Santiago Vidaurri permaneció fuerte hasta el fin de la guerra y el fracaso de la misión confederada.",2022-07-24 20:04:24+00:00,https://t.me/VirginiaFlaggers/1275,,,764,3,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Butler concerning the ladies of New Orleans was read in the camp of the 11th North Carolina regiment, near Wilmington, on the 31st ult., with the following address from Col. Leaventhorpe, of that regiment: Follow Soldiers: The infamous order which you have just heard read proceeds from the General whom the fortune of war has placed in possession of one of the noblest cities of the South. The base enemy whom we oppose, not content with the crimes of invasion, with insurrectionary attempts among our domestic population, and with pillaging the fairest regions of our country, has openly dared to threaten our most sacred relations, and to place our wives and our daughters upon the footing of common prostitutes of the town. Gentlemen of North Carolina, the debased passions of his soldiery needed no such incentive. The records of crime written in the sad annals of Maryland, and in those other unfortunate portions of our country which have been polluted by the enemy's feet, prove but too well the fate, worse than death, which awaits those most dear to us on the event of his conquest and our humiliation. But, fellow soldiers, with the blessing of God, we need fear no such destiny for our country. Relying, then, on that blessing, let us resolve as one man that Wilmington shall not be reached by the invader, and, in the hour of trial, recalling these scandalous threats against the wives and daughters of New Orleans, let us meet him sternly and hurl him back upon his boats at the point of the bayonet.",2022-06-09 19:34:46+00:00,https://t.me/VirginiaFlaggers/1221,,,960,0,14,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They say the impudent miscreants pay them daily visits, take from them what fish they want, and threaten instant death if they attempt to resist or refuse them the fish gratis. I learned yesterday, from a member of the Princess Anne Cavalry, that this defect will be remedied, by mounting several ""baby guns"" near the scene of the enemy's operations, in order to give them a welcome and honorable salute upon their approach. This will be the only effectual means of making them ""move their washing."" Clemency may be shown a national, just as well as an individual enemy until he despises it. It seems to be high time that these inhuman depredations were stopped. These vandals are devoid of dignity and civility, and are estranged from all the fine sensibilities of man. There are indeed homines, but fall far short of being virt. How long will the sons of freedom bear these insults ? How long will the frantic cries of defenceless women, driven from their homes by the oppressors, go unheeded? Will Virginians ever submit to vassalage and wear its galling yoke? No, no, no ! I answer for them.

Built in clear view of the Union forces stationed at Sumter, the floating battery was one hundred feet long, twenty-five-feet wide, and sheathed in two layers of iron plate. It flies the first Confederate flag. Towed into the harbor close to Fort Sumter, Hamilton’s Battery fired on the fort intermittently for thirty-four hours beginning on the morning of April 12. It survived the intense counterattack sustaining little damage; by 1863, however, its protective skin had been stripped off and reused by the Confederacy for the construction of navigable ironclad ships. Southern troops would occupy Fort Sumter until February 17, 1865, when Union General William Tecumseh Sherman’s forces cut off supplies to Charleston and the city itself was evacuated.",2022-06-07 04:14:15+00:00,https://t.me/VirginiaFlaggers/1210,,,451,5,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There may be truth to the claim. Grimball resigned his U.S. Navy commission days after his native South Carolina seceded from the Union and joined the Palmetto State's navy on or about Dec. 29, 1860. He was present when Citadel cadets fired on the ""Star of the West"" on Jan. 9, 1861, preventing her from delivering supplies to Maj. Robert Anderson at Fort Sumter. Grimball went on to become an officer aboard the cruiser ""Shenandoah"" and wreak havoc on Union merchant ships until she surrendered on Nov. 6, 1865—a full seven months after Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House.

During the War for Southern Independence it was the residence of Confederate Patriot Alfred Vidal Davis. Dunlieth is unique as Mississippi's only surviving example of a plantation house with a fully encircling colonnade of Greek Revival columns, a form once seen much more frequently than today. The reason this plantation survives it because Natchez was one of the few Southern towns to escape the destruction of the Yankee invader’s torch, leaving the town with some of the greatest architecture in the Western Hemisphere. #TraditionalSouthernArchitecture",2022-04-16 16:59:23+00:00,https://t.me/VirginiaFlaggers/1000,,,401,2,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lee, Paul Harvey, giving us “the rest of the story,” had this to say on his radio broadcast: “Robert E Lee is to this day the only person to pass through the US Military Academy at West Point without a single demerit. In the Mexican War General Winfield Scott called him “the greatest soldier I’ve ever seen.” As an Army Engineer he re-routed the Mississippi River and saved the city of St Louis. When he inherited slaves from his father in law, he educated them and set them free, and he referred to slavery as “a political and moral evil”. He turned down Lincoln’s offer to Command the US Army that would invade the South and his home State of Virginia even though leading that Army would have certainly brought him international fame and likely the presidency. He instead offered his sword to Virginia and fought against that invasion for four years leading an Army that was vastly outnumbered, out supplied and out fed. After the war, as the most beloved figure on either side of the war, he turned down all of the opportunities that would have enriched him by refusing to sell his family name. He chose instead to take a job with meager pay at Washington College because he knew that rebuilding the country meant that we needed to raise men of high honor and character. His first act as Dean of the College was to build a Chapel. On Lee’s last visit to Richmond, a lady approached General Lee with an infant in her arms and asked “Would you please hold my baby?” General Lee took the child, looked the woman in the eye and said “you must teach him to deny himself.” Biographer Douglas Southall Freeman pointed out that this one statement characterized the entirety of how General Lee lived. As the end of his life was approaching Robert E Lee was asked, with all of his accomplishments, what should his headstone say. He answered! “that I am a poor sinner, trusting in Christ alone for my salvation.” That a monument to this man has been taken down is a monument itself. The barren space where his memorial stood is a testament to the depraved depths to which the morality and character of our society has fallen.”",2022-04-12 18:28:30+00:00,https://t.me/VirginiaFlaggers/991,,,1035,0,39,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this reason, the Confederate government invested heavily in the production of advanced ironclad warships and innovative submarines and torpedo technology to make up for in quality what they lacked in numbers. Despite these noble efforts and the sacrifice of many brave souls aboard Confederate Navy ships and submarines who went into battle vastly outnumbered, Charleston, like most other Southern cities, was largely reduced to rubble by the end of the war.",2022-04-06 06:37:19+00:00,https://t.me/VirginiaFlaggers/957,,,397,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,video/mp4,5.073801637366072e+18,130.0,IMG_6295.MP4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.1767.user.VirginiaFlaggers.post.952,1422276980,VirginiaFlaggers,952,,"The Confederate Hoop Skirt Smugglers During the War for Southern Independence 🇸🇴 In July 1864, four patriotic Southern women risked charges of treason and death during the War for Southern Independence to smuggle needed supplies for Confederate soldiers across the Potomac River from Yankee occupied Maryland. Their story begins on the Maryland-Virginia border in northern Loudoun County, Virginia. The climate of war that framed the journey of Elizabeth White, Kate and Betsie Ball, and Annie Hempstone into Yankee occupied territory to obtain supplies was one of increasing desperation for the Confederacy in its struggle for national independence. The women’s illicit crossing of the Potomac from Virginia to Maryland coincided with a renewed burst of fighting on the border. In July 1864, General Robert E. Lee had ordered General Jubal Early to initiate an attack against Washington D.C., and in tandem with this offensive, Colonel John S. Mosby was sent to sever communication lines between Washington and Harpers Ferry. Col. Mosby succeeded in defeating Yankee forces at their Point of Rocks base on July 5, 1864, and spent the evening dining at the Confederate enclave of Temple Hall. Temple Hall, located north of Leesburg, was the residence of Henry Ball, the father of two patriots in the Confederate army. Ball himself briefly fought early in the war and was once imprisoned for refusing to pledge allegiance to the US government. Also living there during this time was Elizabeth White, the wife of Confederate cavalry officer and patriot Elijah V. White. Mrs. White was not present at that night’s festivities, however, for on that morning she and three friends had embarked on a daring mission north into Yankee occupied Maryland to retrieve supplies for “our dear Maryland boys in grey.” Annie Hempstone later wrote of their adventure as a “little trip across the Potomac,” which belied the true perils of their journey. While guns blazed just up the Potomac River in nearby Point of Rocks on the morning of July 5, 1864, Elizabeth White, Kate and Betsie Ball (daughters of Henry Ball), and Annie Hempstone hurriedly crossed the Potomac at White’s Run. Once in Montgomery County, the four friends quickly set upon their covert mission to collect boots and clothing for Confederate soldiers. The next day, their hoop skirts heavily laden with concealed supplies, the women attempted to return to Loudoun County, Virginia only to find that Union guards had arrived and a river crossing was impossible. The women were forced to retreat to the Dickerson, Maryland home of Elizabeth White’s mother, and fearing arrest, hid their clandestine goods in the walls of the house. Their concerns were soon validated, as the four women were arrested and transported to the Old Capitol Prison in Washington, D.C. (coincidentally where Henry Ball had been imprisoned in 1862.) Though the women were intimately connected to the Confederacy and known to harbor pro-independence secessionist views, no evidence could be found to support the charge of spying. The women maintained that their business in Montgomery County was mere pleasure, and they were released three weeks later. Somehow managing to evade detection, Elizabeth White and her comrades promptly returned to the house in Dickerson, where they retrieved their concealed items, and once again attempted to cross the river, this time at Edward’s Ferry. The river crossing was a precarious and tension-filled affair due to the heavy loads each woman was secretly carrying beneath the folds of her dress. Annie Hempstone seemed to relish the opportunity to incite the ire of the Yankee invaders: “The many letters I received from soldier friends while in prison I was unwilling to give up, so, in packing my valise, I placed them on top, that they might be seen by the Yankee guards who would search our baggage. When they opened my valise and the letters rolled out by the dozen, which I purposefully arranged to aggravate the inspector.",2022-04-05 15:56:44+00:00,https://t.me/VirginiaFlaggers/952,,,336,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Government does not now recognize itself as an ordinance of God, and when all the checks and balances of the Constitution are gone, we may easily figure to ourselves the career and the destiny of this godless monster of democratic absolutism. The progress of regulated liberty on this continent will be arrested, anarchy will soon succeed, and the end will be a military despotism, which preserves order by the sacrifice of the last vestige of liberty. They are now fighting the battle of despotism. They have put their Constitution under their feet; they have annulled its most sacred provisions; The future fortunes of our children, and of this continent, would then be determined by a tyranny which has no parallel in history.” — Dr. James Henly Thornwell of South Carolina, in “Our Danger and our Duty”, 1862",2022-03-29 15:15:13+00:00,https://t.me/VirginiaFlaggers/909,,,375,1,14,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

POLICY Talk not to me of policy, Of what I should or shouldn't do, For, steadfast to my principles, I my course will still pursue. Let judgment shape my actions And my conscience be my guide, For I'd rather face a frowning world Than yield my manly pride. My religion and my politics May I never seek to hide; Let me steer with honest purpose Though I stem against the tide. And fettered not by policy, By precept nor advice, I'll bravely meet my destiny, Though I plunge a precipice. No, I will not be a puppet To any servile course, Though bribed by wealth and laurels And urged by tyrant force; But my deep and clear convictions Shall ever serve to sway, And, with conscience for my shield, Only God I will obey. Then away with all your policy, 'Tis dissembling and deceit- A smiling lie upon the lip A vain, pretending cheat. ""Tis born of fraud and cowardice, No truth is in its name, And I'd rather lose this heart of mine Than sear it with its shame.

Although it was originally intended to have Italian marble columns, they were intercepted by the Yankee naval blockade and impounded, and construction was continued with local brick instead. Chatsworth was never fully completed, but it was reputed to have 50 rooms, and it certainly did have 20 foot high ceilings and silver fixtures. Chatsworth was purchased in 1866 by Francois Gardere, and although the Garderes used it as one of their residences for quite some time, by the early 20th century the house had become semi-derelict. Chatsworth was doomed when the Army Corps of Engineers decided to place the Mississippi River levee on or behind the site of the house. The house was purchased by Jim Blanchard, who partially disassembled it for building materials, before it was demolished in 1930.",2022-03-02 20:15:36+00:00,https://t.me/VirginiaFlaggers/801,,,312,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of our ""boys"" were prone upon this road with knapsacks under our heads, resting, when we noticed the approach of four or five officers on horses. As they drew near we recognized General A. P.

Immediately General Lee said: ""Never mind, General; we will ride round them. Lie still, men.” As he spoke he turned his horse to the left, and General Hill was equally as quick to pull out of the road. They passed within twenty feet of me. Did I see General Hill's face Aush, or did I imagine it? I do not think General Lee thought of rebuking General Hill, then or ever.

To this union were born twelve children, of whom George, Susan, and Thomas died in infancy, Mary at the age of six, and Coralie at the age of eleven. Those who survived to maturity were: John Buchanan, who became Governor of Virginia and a member of President Buchanan's cabinet; William Preston, a distinguished physician of Wytheville, Virginia; George Rogers Clark, secretary of the Wisconsin Territory and later a distinguished member of the legislature of West Virginia; Benjamin Rush, a celebrated lawyer of southwestern Virginia; Letty Preston who married William S. Lewis; Eliza Lavelette who married George Frederick Holmes, long a professor of history and literature in the University of Virginia; and Nicketti Buchanan who married John Warfield Johnston, from 1870 to 1883 a member of the United States Senate."" Through this family, celebrated for its intellect as well as for its numbers, John Floyd's influence survived long after he had passed from the political stage and had much to do with shaping Virginia's policies at critical periods. Almost without exception, his immediate descendants and their connections were persons of political influence devoted to the state sovereignty theory of government. But for them the history of secession in Virginia might have been written differently. Wherever they resided and were active, even in what is now West Virginia, there the pro-southern and secession sentiment was strong; there particularism, as taught by Patrick Henry, flourished.” - Charles Henry Ambler, Ph.D., The Life and Diary of John Floyd, Governor of Virginia, an Apostle of Secession and the Father of the Oregon Country (1918)",2022-01-10 08:33:21+00:00,https://t.me/VirginiaFlaggers/580,,,290,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They have been running round the universe, hat in hand, begging this and that nation to take their part against the Southern rebels, whom they only outnumber three to one, but the responses thus far have been few and unsatisfactory… the United States has no more friends among the European people than among their Governments. This is the testimony of their own letter writers from Paris and London. They are perpetually complaining of the unfriendliness to the North of foreign Governments, and that the foreign press, which expresses the public sentiment of Europe, almost universally sympathizes with the Southern rebels. — On their own showing, they have no friends outside their own limits, but instead of whining and howling over the self-evident fact, they ought to sit down, and candidly and solemnly investigate its causes and consequences… Now the North, in the eyes of universal Christendom, is at present a bankrupt, with this signal difference from the case of a virtuous individual; that it has become a bankrupt by its own crimes and excesses, that its wealth made it licentious, vicious, and cruel; and that its character has become so corrupt and cowardly that even its wealth could scarcely neutralize its putrefying offensiveness in the nostrils of mankind…. This is the reason the North is so unpopular. — It produces nothing that anybody wants; it can no longer furnish Europe with cotton, tobacco and rice; it is looked upon as an impostor and swindler, who has been pretending all along to be the possessor of those staples, when he was the mere factor, employed by the Southern principal to sell his goods, a confidence by which he has grown rich, and which he is now repaying by trying to break into the house of his indulgent patron cut his throat, excite insurrection among his servants, and give over his dwelling to the flames. If the North does not see the turpitude of such conduct, it is the only part of the world which is blind to the glaring iniquity. The consequences are equally palpable with the causes of the universal odium in which the North is held. When a nation excites the detestation of mankind by its vices, and is so weak and devoid of spirit that it can be insulted with impunity, it will not be long before the civilized world chastises it for its offences.”",2022-01-04 00:29:13+00:00,https://t.me/VirginiaFlaggers/564,,,319,1,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For most of the 20th century, Reconstruction was seen as a squalid and shameful coda to the Civil War when Northern Radicals and carpetbaggers enacted their wildest fantasies of humiliation and spoliation on a prostrate South. Starting in the 1960s, a group of revisionist historians began arguing that Reconstruction had actually been a noble experiment in interracial democracy, too quickly abandoned. It is noteworthy that this line started being touted only after the last people with firsthand memories of Reconstruction had died.” https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/reconstruction-revisionism/?fbclid=IwAR3o-W0wsoZtL65iMIZkYjWJl15Fr5I05bw2aKAds8a99-YgNBIg1CsnUZc",2021-12-30 12:55:49+00:00,https://t.me/VirginiaFlaggers/543,,,282,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaWebPage,1,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/reconstruction-revisionism/?fbclid=IwAR3o-W0wsoZtL65iMIZkYjWJl15Fr5I05bw2aKAds8a99-YgNBIg1CsnUZc,theamericanconservative.com,Reconstruction Revisionism - The American Conservative,"The Library of America is reissuing W.E.B.

Born, raised, and educated in the North, he migrated to the South to pursue a medical career but was inspired by the bishop of Tennessee to serve the church. When Tennessee declared independence and seceded from the Union in May 1861, Quintard joined the Confederate 1st Tennessee Infantry Regiment as its chaplain and during the maelstrom of the War for Southern Independence kept a diary of his experiences and even published a Pocket Manual of Devotions for Confederate Troops. After the war he penned a memoir, which was published posthumously in 1905.",2021-12-24 00:06:29+00:00,https://t.me/VirginiaFlaggers/510,,,214,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well we hadn’t any powder, and we hadn’t any shot, And we hadn’t any money to buy what we ain’t got. So we rode our worn-out horses, and we ate on plain cornmeal, And we licked em where we caught em, with Southern guts and steel. We sunk the ship at Sumter, and we broke her plumb in two. We showed them bully Yankees, just what we aimed to do. At a little creek called Bull Run, we took their starry rag, To wipe our horses down with, and I ain’t here to brag. Well there aren’t as many left of us as rode out at the start, And then there are the weary, weak, and body sad of heart.

This book purported to be an exposition of the United States in prophecy. He attempted to show from the ancient prophecies that the United States was to be engaged in war with a great northern power, which he said was Russia, and that the battleground was to be in the valley of the Mississippi. The country to be invaded was a country of unwalled villages, a term that certainly applied with great force to the south of that day, for every plantation was a village. I could not but smile at the thought of a hostile force, even if the country was ever to be at war with a great nation, ever penetrating to my peaceful home, five hundred miles from the coast, and yet a great northern power was in a few years to sweep over the south as with a besom of destruction. Was Baldwin a prophet, or was the great war between the states indeed foretold in ancient scriptures, but not fully understood by Baldwin when he wrote the book? I have the book yet, I think, but have mislaid it and cannot find it; but certain it is that he published the book some five or six years before the war commenced, and in it he said the United States was to be engaged in the war, and that it would commence in about 1861. I hope before I finish this to find the book and correct this statement if I am wrong. He died before the war as I remember, as was reported in the papers, and had been described to me by one who knew him as a strange and peculiar character, indeed thought by some to be deranged.” - Lieutenant Colonel Frank Alexander Montgomery, 1st Mississippi Cavalry C.S.A.",2021-12-12 22:05:08+00:00,https://t.me/VirginiaFlaggers/443,,,199,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The monuments put up “during Jim Crow” were often meant to coincide with the 25th and 50th anniversaries of the war. The 100th anniversary (Centennial) was 1961-1965, and localities were forced to set aside funds to honor it by State Centennial Commissions created by an act of US Congress.

Or Was Secession a Constitutional Right Previous to the War of 1861? by Albert Taylor Bledsoe This book is obscure now, but had an enormous impact in the days after the war. Written by a Southerner, it tears apart piece by piece the Northern constitutional justifications for war. Utilizing the words of the founding generation themselves, Bledsoe demonstrates that that generation conceived of the American Union as a compact and not as a permanent unitary state. He uses direct quotes from the founders to disprove Justices Story and Webster, some of the chief architects of the argument for the existence of a permanent union. Bledsoe even utilizes the words of the justices against themselves, demonstrating the complete absurdity of their position. The book was titled as it was because Jefferson Davis was at the time girded in irons in Fortress Monroe, awaiting a trial for treason that everyone expected. Bledsoe's book so thoroughly demolished the claim that secession was illegal that all plans for prosecution of Davis were scrapped and the Confederate president was released from captivity. The book is clearly, cogently, and wittily written. You get a sense of the glee that Bledsoe had in tearing apart the opinions of some of the most revered legal minds in land. You can print off the book from the attached PDF or if you'd like to buy a copy, the book can be found on Amazon from Forgotten Books.",2021-10-27 06:14:32+00:00,https://t.me/VirginiaFlaggers/352,,,222,5,1,1,PeerChannel,1441541823.0,dailydixie,2021-06-16 11:31:00,2021-06-16,https://t.me/dailydixie/128,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The secretary of the association, Mrs. Charles J. (Mary Ann) Williams was directed to author a letter inviting the ladies in every Southern state to join them in the observance. The letter was written in March of 1866 and sent to all of the principal cities in the South, including Atlanta, Macon, Montgomery, Memphis, Richmond, St. Louis, Alexandria, Columbia, New Orleans, et al. The date for the holiday was selected by Mrs. Elizabeth Rutherford Ellis. She chose April 26, the first anniversary of Confederate General Johnston's final surrender to Union General Sherman at Bennett Place, NC.

I used to think that they were things the wonderful folk of the stories went out and looked for, because they wanted them, because they were exciting and life was a bit dull, a kind of a sport, as you might say. But that’s not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or the ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them, usually their paths were laid that way, as you put it.

Yet after the fall of Sauron their power was ever at work, and where they abode there mirth also dwelt and all things were unstained by the griefs of time. Therefore ere the Third Age was ended the Elves perceived that the Ring of Sapphire was with Elrond, in the fair valley of Rivendell, upon whose house the stars of heaven most brightly shone whereas the Ring of Adamant was in the Land of Lórien where dwelt the Lady Galadriel. A queen she was of the woodland Elves, the wife of Celeborn of Doriath, yet she herself was of the Noldor and remembered the Day before days in Valinor, and she was the mightiest and fairest of all the Elves that remained in Middle-earth. But the Red Ring remained hidden until the end, and none save Elrond and Galadriel and Cirdan knew to whom it had been committed. Thus it was that in two domains the bliss and beauty of the Elves remained still undiminished while that Age endured: in Imladris and in Lothlórien, the hidden land between Celebrant and Anduin, where the trees bore flowers of gold and no Orc or evil thing dared ever come. Yet many voices were heard among the Elves foreboding that, if Sauron should come again, then either he would find the Ruling Ring that was lost, or at the best his enemies would discover it and destroy it but in either chance the powers of the Three must then fail and all things maintained by them must fade, and so the Elves should pass into the twilight and the Dominion of Men begin. And so indeed it has since befallen: the One and the Seven and the Nine are destroyed and the Three have passed away, and with them the Third Age is ended, and the Tales of the Eldar in Middle-earth draw to then-close.” - The Silmarillion",2024-09-25 16:00:30+00:00,https://t.me/jrr_tolkien_quotes/12146,,,612,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From a mouth unseen there came a deadly laughter. ""Old fool!"" he said. ""Old fool! This is my hour. Do you not know Death when you see it? Die now and curse in vain!"" And with that he lifted high his sword and flames ran down the blade. And in that very moment, away behind in some courtyard of the city, a cock crowed.

But that's not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or the ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them, usually — their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn't. And if they had, we shouldn't know, because they'd have been forgotten. We hear about those as just went on — and not all to a good end, mind you at least not to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end. You know, coming home, and finding things all right, though not quite the same — like old Mr Bilbo. But those aren't always the best tales to hear, though they may be the best tales to get landed in!

But these evils can be amended, so strong and gay a spirit is in him. His grief he will not forget but it will not darken his heart, it will teach him wisdom.'

And when the fragrance of athelas stole through the room, like the scent of orchards, and of heather in the sunshine full of bees, suddenly Merry awoke, and he said: 'I am hungry. What is the time?' 'Past supper-time now,' said Pippin 'though I daresay I could bring you something, if they will let me.' 'They will indeed,"" said Gandalf, .

I propose, therefore, to arrogate to myself the powers of Humpty-Dumpty, and to use Fantasy for this purpose: in a sense, that is, which combines with its older and higher use as an equivalent of Imagination the derived notions of 'unreality' (that is, of unlikeness to the Primary World), of freedom from the dominion of 'observed fact,' in short of the fantastic. I am thus not only aware but glad of the etymological and semantic connexions of fantasy with fantastic: with images of things that are not only 'not actually present,' but which are indeed not to be found in our primary world at all, or are generally believed not to be found there. But while admitting that, I do not assent to the depreciative tone. That the images are of things not in the primary world (if that indeed is possible) is, I think, not a lower but a higher form of Art, indeed the most nearly pure form, and so (when achieved) the most Potent. Fantasy, of course, starts out with an advantage: arresting strangeness. But that advantage has been turned against it, and has contributed to its disrepute. Many people dislike being 'arrested.' They dislike any meddling with the Primary World, or such small glimpses of it as are familiar to them. They, therefore, stupidly and even maliciously confound Fantasy with Dreaming, in which there is no Art and with mental disorders, in which there is not even control with delusion and hallucination. But the error or malice, engendered by disquiet and consequent dislike, is not the only cause of this confusion. Fantasy has also an essential drawback: it is difficult to achieve. . . . Anyone inheriting the fantastic device of human language can say the green sun. Many can then imagine or picture it. But that is not enough -- though it may already be a more potent thing than many a 'thumbnail sketch' or 'transcript of life' that receives literary praise. To make a Secondary World inside which the green sun will be credible, commanding Secondary Belief, will probably require labour and thought, and will certainly demand a special skill, a kind of elvish craft. Few attempt such difficult tasks. But when they are attempted and in any degree accomplished then we have a rare achievement of Art: indeed narrative art, story-making in its primary and most potent mode.”",2024-06-02 16:00:41+00:00,https://t.me/jrr_tolkien_quotes/11790,,,459,1,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You aren’t fit to walk any further. They shouldn’t have let you walk at all but you must forgive them. So many dreadful things have happened in the City, Merry, that one poor hobbit coming in from battle is easily overlooked.’ ‘It’s not always a misfortune being overlooked,’ said Merry. ‘I was overlooked just now by—no, no, I can’t speak of it.

[...]As they sang the hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands and by cunning and by magic moving through him, a fierce and jealous love, the desire of the hearts of dwarves. Then something Tookish woke up inside him, and he wished to go and see the great mountains, and hear the pine-trees and the waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking-stick. He looked out of the window. The stars were out in a dark sky above the trees. He thought of the jewels of the dwarves shining in dark caverns. Suddenly in the wood beyond The Water a flame leapt up - probably somebody lighting a wood-fire-and he thought of plundering dragons settling on his quiet Hill and kindling it all to flames.

I propose, therefore, to arrogate to myself the powers of Humpty-Dumpty, and to use Fantasy for this purpose: in a sense, that is, which combines with its older and higher use as an equivalent of Imagination the derived notions of 'unreality' (that is, of unlikeness to the Primary World), of freedom from the dominion of 'observed fact,' in short of the fantastic. I am thus not only aware but glad of the etymological and semantic connexions of fantasy with fantastic: with images of things that are not only 'not actually present,' but which are indeed not to be found in our primary world at all, or are generally believed not to be found there. But while admitting that, I do not assent to the depreciative tone. That the images are of things not in the primary world (if that indeed is possible) is, I think, not a lower but a higher form of Art, indeed the most nearly pure form, and so (when achieved) the most Potent. Fantasy, of course, starts out with an advantage: arresting strangeness. But that advantage has been turned against it, and has contributed to its disrepute. Many people dislike being 'arrested.' They dislike any meddling with the Primary World, or such small glimpses of it as are familiar to them. They, therefore, stupidly and even maliciously confound Fantasy with Dreaming, in which there is no Art and with mental disorders, in which there is not even control with delusion and hallucination. But the error or malice, engendered by disquiet and consequent dislike, is not the only cause of this confusion. Fantasy has also an essential drawback: it is difficult to achieve. . . . Anyone inheriting the fantastic device of human language can say the green sun. Many can then imagine or picture it. But that is not enough -- though it may already be a more potent thing than many a 'thumbnail sketch' or 'transcript of life' that receives literary praise. To make a Secondary World inside which the green sun will be credible, commanding Secondary Belief, will probably require labour and thought, and will certainly demand a special skill, a kind of elvish craft. Few attempt such difficult tasks. But when they are attempted and in any degree accomplished then we have a rare achievement of Art: indeed narrative art, story-making in its primary and most potent mode.”",2024-05-15 16:00:29+00:00,https://t.me/jrr_tolkien_quotes/11687,,,448,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'Do not be afraid,' Aragorn said, 'I came in time, and I have called him back. He is weary now, and grieved, and he has taken a hurt like the lady Eowyn, daring to smite that deadly thing. But these evils can be amended, so strong and gay a spirit is in him. His grief he will not forget but it will not darken his heart, it will teach him wisdom.' Then Aragorn laid his hand on Merry's head, and passing his hand gently through the brown curls , he touched the eyelids, and called him by name. And when the fragrance of athelas stole through the room, like the scent of orchards, and of heather in the sunshine full of bees, suddenly Merry awoke, and he said: 'I am hungry. What is the time?'

He may have meant that the way men were living and working in the twentieth century was increasing in barbarity at an alarming rate, and that the loud demonstration of this in the streets of Oxford might serve as a warning that it is not possible to preserve for long an oasis of sanity in a desert of unreason by mere fences, without actual offensive action (practical and intellectual). I fear he did not. In any case the expression 'real life' in this context seems to fall short of academic standards. The notion that motor-cars are more 'alive' than, say, centaurs or dragons is curious that they are more 'real' than, say, horses is pathetically absurd.

Yet after the fall of Sauron their power was ever at work, and where they abode there mirth also dwelt and all things were unstained by the griefs of time. Therefore ere the Third Age was ended the Elves perceived that the Ring of Sapphire was with Elrond, in the fair valley of Rivendell, upon whose house the stars of heaven most brightly shone whereas the Ring of Adamant was in the Land of Lórien where dwelt the Lady Galadriel. A queen she was of the woodland Elves, the wife of Celeborn of Doriath, yet she herself was of the Noldor and remembered the Day before days in Valinor, and she was the mightiest and fairest of all the Elves that remained in Middle-earth. But the Red Ring remained hidden until the end, and none save Elrond and Galadriel and Cirdan knew to whom it had been committed. Thus it was that in two domains the bliss and beauty of the Elves remained still undiminished while that Age endured: in Imladris and in Lothlórien, the hidden land between Celebrant and Anduin, where the trees bore flowers of gold and no Orc or evil thing dared ever come. Yet many voices were heard among the Elves foreboding that, if Sauron should come again, then either he would find the Ruling Ring that was lost, or at the best his enemies would discover it and destroy it but in either chance the powers of the Three must then fail and all things maintained by them must fade, and so the Elves should pass into the twilight and the Dominion of Men begin. And so indeed it has since befallen: the One and the Seven and the Nine are destroyed and the Three have passed away, and with them the Third Age is ended, and the Tales of the Eldar in Middle-earth draw to then-close.” - The Silmarillion",2024-04-08 16:00:36+00:00,https://t.me/jrr_tolkien_quotes/11472,,,494,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It certainly does not destroy or even insult Reason and it does not either blunt the appetite for, nor obscure the perception of, scientific verity. On the contrary. The keener and the clearer is the reason, the better fantasy will it make. If men were ever in a state in which they did not want to know or could not perceive truth (facts or evidence), then Fantasy would languish until they were cured. If they ever get into that state (it would not seem at all impossible), Fantasy will perish, and become Morbid Delusion. For creative Fantasy is founded upon the hard recognition that things are so in the world as it appears under the sun on a recognition of fact, but not a slavery to it. So upon logic was founded the nonsense that displays itself in the tales and rhymes of Lewis Carroll.

Gollum looked at them. A strange expression passed over his lean hungry face. The gleam faded from his eyes, and they went dim and grey, old and tired. A spasm of pain seemed to twist him, and he turned away, peering back up towards the pass, shaking his head, as if engaged in some interior debate.

The world was fair, the mountains tall, In Elder Days before the fall Of mighty kings in Nargothrond And Gondolin, who now beyond The Western Seas have passed away: The world was fair in Durin's Day. A king he was on carven throne In many-pillared halls of stone With golden roof and silver floor, And runes of power upon the door. The light of sun and star and moon In shining lamps of crystal hewn Undimmed by cloud or shade of night There shone for ever fair and bright. There hammer on the anvil smote, There chisel clove, and graver wrote There forged was blade, and bound was hilt The delver mined, the mason built. There beryl, pearl, and opal pale, And metal wrought like fishes' mail, Buckler and corslet, axe and sword, And shining spears were laid in hoard. Unwearied then were Durin's folk Beneath the mountains music woke: The harpers harped, the minstrels sang, And at the gates the trumpets rang. The world is grey, the mountains old, The forge's fire is ashen-cold No harp is wrung, no hammer falls: The darkness dwells in Durin's halls The shadow lies upon his tomb In Moria, in Khazad-dûm.

He rubbed his eyes. ‘Where is the king?’ He said. ‘And Eowyn?’ Then he stumbled and sat down on a doorstep and began to weep again. ‘They must have gone up into the Citadel,’ said Pippin. ‘I think you must have fallen asleep on your feet and taken the wrong turning.

You aren’t fit to walk any further. They shouldn’t have let you walk at all but you must forgive them. So many dreadful things have happened in the City, Merry, that one poor hobbit coming in from battle is easily overlooked.’ ‘It’s not always a misfortune being overlooked,’ said Merry. ‘I was overlooked just now by—no, no, I can’t speak of it.

Yet after the fall of Sauron their power was ever at work, and where they abode there mirth also dwelt and all things were unstained by the griefs of time. Therefore ere the Third Age was ended the Elves perceived that the Ring of Sapphire was with Elrond, in the fair valley of Rivendell, upon whose house the stars of heaven most brightly shone whereas the Ring of Adamant was in the Land of Lórien where dwelt the Lady Galadriel. A queen she was of the woodland Elves, the wife of Celeborn of Doriath, yet she herself was of the Noldor and remembered the Day before days in Valinor, and she was the mightiest and fairest of all the Elves that remained in Middle-earth. But the Red Ring remained hidden until the end, and none save Elrond and Galadriel and Cirdan knew to whom it had been committed. Thus it was that in two domains the bliss and beauty of the Elves remained still undiminished while that Age endured: in Imladris and in Lothlórien, the hidden land between Celebrant and Anduin, where the trees bore flowers of gold and no Orc or evil thing dared ever come. Yet many voices were heard among the Elves foreboding that, if Sauron should come again, then either he would find the Ruling Ring that was lost, or at the best his enemies would discover it and destroy it but in either chance the powers of the Three must then fail and all things maintained by them must fade, and so the Elves should pass into the twilight and the Dominion of Men begin. And so indeed it has since befallen: the One and the Seven and the Nine are destroyed and the Three have passed away, and with them the Third Age is ended, and the Tales of the Eldar in Middle-earth draw to then-close.” - The Silmarillion",2024-01-18 08:00:31+00:00,https://t.me/jrr_tolkien_quotes/10998,,,365,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I used to think that they were things the wonderful folk of the stories went out and looked for, because they wanted them, because they were exciting and life was a bit dull, a kind of a sport, as you might say. But that's not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or the ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them, usually — their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn't. And if they had, we shouldn't know, because they'd have been forgotten. We hear about those as just went on — and not all to a good end, mind you at least not to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end. You know, coming home, and finding things all right, though not quite the same — like old Mr Bilbo. But those aren't always the best tales to hear, though they may be the best tales to get landed in!

The keener and the clearer is the reason, the better fantasy will it make. If men were ever in a state in which they did not want to know or could not perceive truth (facts or evidence), then Fantasy would languish until they were cured. If they ever get into that state (it would not seem at all impossible), Fantasy will perish, and become Morbid Delusion. For creative Fantasy is founded upon the hard recognition that things are so in the world as it appears under the sun on a recognition of fact, but not a slavery to it. So upon logic was founded the nonsense that displays itself in the tales and rhymes of Lewis Carroll.

And with that he lifted high his sword and flames ran down the blade. And in that very moment, away behind in some courtyard of the city, a cock crowed. Shrill and clear he crowed, recking nothing of war nor of wizardry, welcoming only the morning that in the sky far above the shadows of death was coming with the dawn. And as if in answer there came from far away another note. Horns, horns, horns, in dark Mindolluin's sides they dimly echoed. Great horns of the north wildly blowing.

It does not deny the existence of dyscatastrophe, of sorrow and failure: the possibility of these is necessary to the joy of deliverance it denies (in the face of much evidence, if you will) universal final defeat and in so far is evangelium, giving a fleeting glimpse of Joy, Joy beyond the walls of the world, poignant as grief. It is the mark of a good fairy-story, of the higher or more complete kind, that however wild its events, however fantastic or terrible the adventures, it can give to child or man that hears it, when the “turn” comes, a catch of the breath, a beat and lifting of the heart, near to (or indeed accompanied by) tears, as keen as that given by any form of literary art, and having a peculiar quality ...

He named the nameless hills and dells He drank from yet untasted wells He stooped and looked in Mirrormere, And saw a crown of stars appear, As gems upon a silver thread, Above the shadow of his head. The world was fair, the mountains tall, In Elder Days before the fall Of mighty kings in Nargothrond And Gondolin, who now beyond The Western Seas have passed away: The world was fair in Durin's Day. A king he was on carven throne In many-pillared halls of stone With golden roof and silver floor, And runes of power upon the door. The light of sun and star and moon In shining lamps of crystal hewn Undimmed by cloud or shade of night There shone for ever fair and bright. There hammer on the anvil smote, There chisel clove, and graver wrote There forged was blade, and bound was hilt The delver mined, the mason built. There beryl, pearl, and opal pale, And metal wrought like fishes' mail, Buckler and corslet, axe and sword, And shining spears were laid in hoard. Unwearied then were Durin's folk Beneath the mountains music woke: The harpers harped, the minstrels sang, And at the gates the trumpets rang. The world is grey, the mountains old, The forge's fire is ashen-cold No harp is wrung, no hammer falls: The darkness dwells in Durin's halls The shadow lies upon his tomb In Moria, in Khazad-dûm. But still the sunken stars appear In dark and windless Mirrormere There lies his crown in water deep, Till Durin wakes again from sleep. -The Song of Durin”",2023-12-22 00:00:28+00:00,https://t.me/jrr_tolkien_quotes/10844,,,344,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It does not deny the existence of dyscatastrophe, of sorrow and failure: the possibility of these is necessary to the joy of deliverance it denies (in the face of much evidence, if you will) universal final defeat and in so far is evangelium, giving a fleeting glimpse of Joy, Joy beyond the walls of the world, poignant as grief. It is the mark of a good fairy-story, of the higher or more complete kind, that however wild its events, however fantastic or terrible the adventures, it can give to child or man that hears it, when the “turn” comes, a catch of the breath, a beat and lifting of the heart, near to (or indeed accompanied by) tears, as keen as that given by any form of literary art, and having a peculiar quality ...

'And we shouldn't be here at all, if we'd known more about it before we started. But I suppose it's often that way. The brave things in the old tales and songs, Mr. Frodo: adventures, as I used to call them. I used to think that they were things the wonderful folk of the stories went out and looked for, because they wanted them, because they were exciting and life was a bit dull, a kind of a sport, as you might say. But that's not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or the ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them, usually – their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn't. And if they had, we shouldn't know, because they'd have been forgotten. We hear about those as just went on – and not all to a good end, mind you at least not to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end. You know, coming home, and finding things all right, though not quite the same – like old Mr Bilbo. But those aren't always the best tales to hear, though they may be the best tales to get landed in! I wonder what sort of a tale we've fallen into?' 'I wonder,' said Frodo. 'But I don't know. And that's the way of a real tale. Take any one that you're fond of. You may know, or guess, what kind of a tale it is, happy-ending or sad-ending, but the people in it don't know. And you don't want them to.' 'No, sir, of course not. Beren now, he never thought he was going to get that Silmaril from the Iron Crown in Thangorodrim, and yet he did, and that was a worse place and a blacker danger than ours. But that's a long tale, of course, and goes on past the happiness and into grief and beyond it – and the Silmaril went on and came to Eärendil. And why, sir, I never thought of that before! We've got – you've got some of the light of it in that star-glass that the Lady gave you! Why, to think of it, we're in the same tale still! It's going on. Don't the great tales never end?' 'No, they never end as tales,' said Frodo. 'But the people in them come, and go when their part's ended. Our part will end later – or sooner.” - The Two Towers",2023-11-02 00:00:24+00:00,https://t.me/jrr_tolkien_quotes/10551,,,310,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It certainly does not destroy or even insult Reason and it does not either blunt the appetite for, nor obscure the perception of, scientific verity. On the contrary. The keener and the clearer is the reason, the better fantasy will it make. If men were ever in a state in which they did not want to know or could not perceive truth (facts or evidence), then Fantasy would languish until they were cured. If they ever get into that state (it would not seem at all impossible), Fantasy will perish, and become Morbid Delusion. For creative Fantasy is founded upon the hard recognition that things are so in the world as it appears under the sun on a recognition of fact, but not a slavery to it. So upon logic was founded the nonsense that displays itself in the tales and rhymes of Lewis Carroll. If men really could not distinguish between frogs and men, fairy-stories about frog-kings would not have arisen.” - Tolkien on Fairy-stories",2023-11-01 16:00:28+00:00,https://t.me/jrr_tolkien_quotes/10549,,,362,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We’re going on a bit too fast. You and I, Sam, are still stuck in the worst places of the story, and it is all too likely that some will say at this point ‘Shut the book now, dad we don’t want to read any more’.” “Maybe,” said Sam, “but I wouldn’t be one to say that. Things done and over and made into part of the great tales are different. Why, even Gollum might be good in a tale, better than he is to have by you, anyway.

As soon as Sauron set the One Ring upon his finger they were aware of him and they knew him, and perceived that he would be master of them, and of an that they wrought. Then in anger and fear they took off their rings. But he, finding that he was betrayed and that the Elves were not deceived, was filled with wrath and he came against them with open war, demanding that all the rings should be delivered to him, since the Elven-smiths could not have attained to their making without his lore and counsel. But the Elves fled from him and three of their rings they saved, and bore them away, and hid them. Now these were the Three that had last been made, and they possessed the greatest powers. Narya, Nenya, and Vilya, they were named, the Rings of Fire, and of Water, and of Air, set with ruby and adamant and sapphire and of all the Elven-rings Sauron most desired to possess them, for those who had them in their keeping could ward off the decays of time and postpone the weariness of the world. But Sauron could not discover them, for they were given into the hands of the Wise, who concealed them and never again used them openly while Sauron kept the Ruling Ring. Therefore the Three remained unsullied, for they were forged by Celebrimbor alone, and the hand of Sauron had never touched them yet they also were subject to the One.” - The Silmarillion",2023-10-07 16:00:24+00:00,https://t.me/jrr_tolkien_quotes/10406,,,304,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'And we shouldn't be here at all, if we'd known more about it before we started. But I suppose it's often that way. The brave things in the old tales and songs, Mr. Frodo: adventures, as I used to call them. I used to think that they were things the wonderful folk of the stories went out and looked for, because they wanted them, because they were exciting and life was a bit dull, a kind of a sport, as you might say. But that's not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or the ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them, usually – their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn't. And if they had, we shouldn't know, because they'd have been forgotten. We hear about those as just went on – and not all to a good end, mind you at least not to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end. You know, coming home, and finding things all right, though not quite the same – like old Mr Bilbo. But those aren't always the best tales to hear, though they may be the best tales to get landed in! I wonder what sort of a tale we've fallen into?' 'I wonder,' said Frodo. 'But I don't know. And that's the way of a real tale. Take any one that you're fond of. You may know, or guess, what kind of a tale it is, happy-ending or sad-ending, but the people in it don't know. And you don't want them to.' 'No, sir, of course not. Beren now, he never thought he was going to get that Silmaril from the Iron Crown in Thangorodrim, and yet he did, and that was a worse place and a blacker danger than ours. But that's a long tale, of course, and goes on past the happiness and into grief and beyond it – and the Silmaril went on and came to Eärendil. And why, sir, I never thought of that before! We've got – you've got some of the light of it in that star-glass that the Lady gave you! Why, to think of it, we're in the same tale still! It's going on. Don't the great tales never end?'

There are columns of white and saffron and dawn-rose, Legolas, fluted and twisted into dreamlike forms they spring up from many-coloured floors to meet the glistening pendants of the roof: wings, ropes, curtains fine as frozen clouds spears, banners, pinnacles of suspended palaces! Still lakes mirror them: a glimmering world looks up from dark pools covered with clear glass cities, such as the mind of Durin could scarce have imagined in his sleep, stretch on through avenues and pillared courts, on into the dark recesses where no light can come, And plink! A silver drop falls, and the round wrinkles in the glass make all the towers bend and waver like weeds and corals in a grotto of the sea. Then evening comes:” they fade and twinkle out the torches pass on into another chamber and another dream.

Maedhros therefore, being in anguish without hope, begged Fingon to shoot him with his bow and Fingon strung an arrow, and bent his bow. And seeing no better hope he cried to Manwe, saying: 'O King to whom birds are dear, speed now this feathered shaft, and recall some pity for the Noldor in their need!'....Now, even as Fingon bent his bow, there flew down from the high airs Thorondor, King of Eagles, mightiest of all birds that have ever been, whose outstretched wings spanned thirty fathoms and staying Fingon's hand he took him up, and bore him to the face of the rock where Maethros hung.” - The Silmarillion",2023-09-04 16:00:21+00:00,https://t.me/jrr_tolkien_quotes/10219,,,282,1,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He opened his eyes and the blackness was lifted from them. There some paces from him sat the great beast, and all seemed dark about it, and above it loomed the Nazgul Lord like a shadow of despair. A little to the left facing them stood whom he had called Dernhelm. But the helm of her secrecy had fallen from her, and and her bright hair, released from its bonds, gleamed with pale gold upon her shoulders.

In rode the Lord of the Nazgûl, under the archway that no enemy ever yet had passed, and all fled before his face. All save one.

The Black Rider flung back his hood, and behold! he had a kingly crown and yet upon no head visible was it set. The red fires shone between it and the mantled shoulders vast and dark. From a mouth unseen there came a deadly laughter. ""Old fool!"" he said. ""Old fool! This is my hour. Do you not know Death when you see it? Die now and curse in vain!"" And with that he lifted high his sword and flames ran down the blade. And in that very moment, away behind in some courtyard of the city, a cock crowed. Shrill and clear he crowed, recking nothing of war nor of wizardry, welcoming only the morning that in the sky far above the shadows of death was coming with the dawn.

It certainly does not destroy or even insult Reason and it does not either blunt the appetite for, nor obscure the perception of, scientific verity. On the contrary. The keener and the clearer is the reason, the better fantasy will it make. If men were ever in a state in which they did not want to know or could not perceive truth (facts or evidence), then Fantasy would languish until they were cured. If they ever get into that state (it would not seem at all impossible), Fantasy will perish, and become Morbid Delusion. For creative Fantasy is founded upon the hard recognition that things are so in the world as it appears under the sun on a recognition of fact, but not a slavery to it. So upon logic was founded the nonsense that displays itself in the tales and rhymes of Lewis Carroll.

As the light upon the leaves of trees, as the voice of clear waters, as the stars above the mists of the world, such was her glory and her loveliness and in her face was a shining light. But she vanished from his sigh and he became dumb, as one that is bound under a spell, and he strayed long in the woods, wild and wary as a beast, seeking for her. In his heart he called her Tinúviel, that signifies Nightingale, daughter of twilight, in the Grey-elven tongue, for he knew no other name for her.

Enchantment healed his weary feet That over hills were doomed to roam And forth he hastened, strong and fleet, And grasped at moonbeams glistening. Through woven woods in Elvenhome She lightly fled on dancing feet, And left him lonely still to roam In the silent forest listening. He heard there oft the flying sound Of feet as light as linden-leaves, Or music welling underground, In hidden hollows quavering. Now withered lay the hemlock-sheaves, And one by one with sighing sound Whispering fell the beechen leaves In the wintry woodland wavering. He sought her ever, wandering far Where leaves of years were thickly strewn, By light of moon and ray of star In frosty heavens shivering. Her mantle glinted in the moon, As on a hill-top high and far She danced, and at her feet was strewn A mist of silver quivering. When winter passed, she came again, And her song released the sudden spring, Like rising lark, and falling rain, And melting water bubbling. He saw the elven-flowers spring About her feet, and healed again He longed by her to dance and sing Upon the grass untroubling. Again she fled, but swift he came. Tinuviel! Tinuviel! He called her by her elvish name And there she halted listening. One moment stood she, and a spell His voice laid on her: Beren came, And doom fell on Tinuviel That in his arms lay glistening. As Beren looked into her eyes Within the shadows of her hair, The trembling starlight of the skies He saw there mirrored shimmering. Tinuviel the elven-fair, Immortal maiden elven-wise, About him cast her shadowy hair And arms like silver glimmering. Long was the way that fate them bore, O'er stony mountains cold and grey, Through halls of iron and darkling door, And woods of nightshade morrowless. The Sundering Seas between them lay, And yet at last they met once more, And long ago they passed away In the forest singing sorrowless.” - The Lord of the Rings",2023-06-13 00:00:20+00:00,https://t.me/jrr_tolkien_quotes/9734,,,281,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet after the fall of Sauron their power was ever at work, and where they abode there mirth also dwelt and all things were unstained by the griefs of time. Therefore ere the Third Age was ended the Elves perceived that the Ring of Sapphire was with Elrond, in the fair valley of Rivendell, upon whose house the stars of heaven most brightly shone whereas the Ring of Adamant was in the Land of Lórien where dwelt the Lady Galadriel. A queen she was of the woodland Elves, the wife of Celeborn of Doriath, yet she herself was of the Noldor and remembered the Day before days in Valinor, and she was the mightiest and fairest of all the Elves that remained in Middle-earth. But the Red Ring remained hidden until the end, and none save Elrond and Galadriel and Cirdan knew to whom it had been committed. Thus it was that in two domains the bliss and beauty of the Elves remained still undiminished while that Age endured: in Imladris and in Lothlórien, the hidden land between Celebrant and Anduin, where the trees bore flowers of gold and no Orc or evil thing dared ever come. Yet many voices were heard among the Elves foreboding that, if Sauron should come again, then either he would find the Ruling Ring that was lost, or at the best his enemies would discover it and destroy it but in either chance the powers of the Three must then fail and all things maintained by them must fade, and so the Elves should pass into the twilight and the Dominion of Men begin. And so indeed it has since befallen: the One and the Seven and the Nine are destroyed and the Three have passed away, and with them the Third Age is ended, and the Tales of the Eldar in Middle-earth draw to then-close.” - The Silmarillion",2023-06-12 16:00:27+00:00,https://t.me/jrr_tolkien_quotes/9732,,,278,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tinuviel was dancing there To music of a pipe unseen, And light of stars was in her hair, And in her raiment glimmering. There Beren came from mountains cold, And lost he wandered under leaves, And where the Elven-river rolled. He walked along and sorrowing. He peered between the hemlock-leaves And saw in wonder flowers of gold Upon her mantle and her sleeves, And her hair like shadow following. Enchantment healed his weary feet That over hills were doomed to roam And forth he hastened, strong and fleet, And grasped at moonbeams glistening. Through woven woods in Elvenhome She lightly fled on dancing feet, And left him lonely still to roam In the silent forest listening. He heard there oft the flying sound Of feet as light as linden-leaves, Or music welling underground, In hidden hollows quavering. Now withered lay the hemlock-sheaves, And one by one with sighing sound Whispering fell the beechen leaves In the wintry woodland wavering. He sought her ever, wandering far Where leaves of years were thickly strewn, By light of moon and ray of star In frosty heavens shivering. Her mantle glinted in the moon, As on a hill-top high and far She danced, and at her feet was strewn A mist of silver quivering. When winter passed, she came again, And her song released the sudden spring, Like rising lark, and falling rain, And melting water bubbling. He saw the elven-flowers spring About her feet, and healed again He longed by her to dance and sing Upon the grass untroubling. Again she fled, but swift he came. Tinuviel! Tinuviel! He called her by her elvish name And there she halted listening. One moment stood she, and a spell His voice laid on her: Beren came, And doom fell on Tinuviel That in his arms lay glistening. As Beren looked into her eyes Within the shadows of her hair, The trembling starlight of the skies He saw there mirrored shimmering. Tinuviel the elven-fair, Immortal maiden elven-wise, About him cast her shadowy hair And arms like silver glimmering. Long was the way that fate them bore, O'er stony mountains cold and grey, Through halls of iron and darkling door, And woods of nightshade morrowless.

As Beren looked into her eyes Within the shadows of her hair, The trembling starlight of the skies He saw there mirrored shimmering. Tinuviel the elven-fair, Immortal maiden elven-wise, About him cast her shadowy hair And arms like silver glimmering. Long was the way that fate them bore, O'er stony mountains cold and grey, Through halls of iron and darkling door, And woods of nightshade morrowless. The Sundering Seas between them lay, And yet at last they met once more, And long ago they passed away In the forest singing sorrowless.” - The Lord of the Rings",2023-05-27 08:00:21+00:00,https://t.me/jrr_tolkien_quotes/9636,,,242,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A broken sword was on his knee. I saw many wounds on him. it was Boromir, my brother, dead. I knew his gear, his sword, his beloved face. One thing only I missed: his horn. One thing only I knew not: a fair belt, as it were of linked golden leaves, about his waist. Boromir! I cried. Where is thy horn? Whither goest thou? O Boromir! But he was gone.

But his friends coming perceived at once (without troubling to climb the steps) that these stones had formerly belonged to a more ancient building. So they pushed the tower over, with no little labour, and in order to look for hidden carvings and inscriptions, or to discover whence the man's distant forefathers had obtained their building material. Some suspecting a deposit of coal under the soil began to dig for it, and forgot even the stones. They all said: 'This tower is most interesting.' But they also said (after pushing it over): 'What a muddle it is in!' And even the man's own descendants, who might have been expected to consider what he had been about, were heard to murmur: 'He is such an odd fellow! Imagine using these old stones just to build a nonsensical tower! Why did not he restore the old house? he had no sense of proportion.'

He named the nameless hills and dells He drank from yet untasted wells He stooped and looked in Mirrormere, And saw a crown of stars appear, As gems upon a silver thread, Above the shadow of his head. The world was fair, the mountains tall, In Elder Days before the fall Of mighty kings in Nargothrond And Gondolin, who now beyond The Western Seas have passed away: The world was fair in Durin's Day. A king he was on carven throne In many-pillared halls of stone With golden roof and silver floor, And runes of power upon the door. The light of sun and star and moon In shining lamps of crystal hewn Undimmed by cloud or shade of night There shone for ever fair and bright. There hammer on the anvil smote, There chisel clove, and graver wrote There forged was blade, and bound was hilt The delver mined, the mason built. There beryl, pearl, and opal pale, And metal wrought like fishes' mail, Buckler and corslet, axe and sword, And shining spears were laid in hoard. Unwearied then were Durin's folk Beneath the mountains music woke: The harpers harped, the minstrels sang, And at the gates the trumpets rang. The world is grey, the mountains old, The forge's fire is ashen-cold No harp is wrung, no hammer falls: The darkness dwells in Durin's halls The shadow lies upon his tomb In Moria, in Khazad-dûm. But still the sunken stars appear In dark and windless Mirrormere There lies his crown in water deep, Till Durin wakes again from sleep. -The Song of Durin”",2023-03-27 08:00:24+00:00,https://t.me/jrr_tolkien_quotes/9319,,,251,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Far over the misty mountains cold To dungeons deep and caverns old We must away, ere break of day, To claim our long-forgotten gold.

The bells were ringing in the dale And men looked up with faces pale The dragon's ire more fierce than fire Laid low their towers and houses frail. The mountain smoked beneath the moon The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom. They fled their hall to dying fall Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.

Of the old stone some had already been used in building the house in which he actually lived, not far from the old house of his fathers. Of the rest he took some and built a tower. But his friends coming perceived at once (without troubling to climb the steps) that these stones had formerly belonged to a more ancient building. So they pushed the tower over, with no little labour, and in order to look for hidden carvings and inscriptions, or to discover whence the man's distant forefathers had obtained their building material. Some suspecting a deposit of coal under the soil began to dig for it, and forgot even the stones. They all said: 'This tower is most interesting.' But they also said (after pushing it over): 'What a muddle it is in!' And even the man's own descendants, who might have been expected to consider what he had been about, were heard to murmur: 'He is such an odd fellow! Imagine using these old stones just to build a nonsensical tower! Why did not he restore the old house? he had no sense of proportion.'

Be thankful no longer words were aimed at you. He had his eyes on you. If it is any comfort to your pride, I should say that, at the moment, you and Pippin are more in his thoughts than the rest of us. Who you are how you came here, and why what you know whether you were captured, and if so, how you escaped when all the orcs perished—it is with those little riddles that the great mind of Saruman is troubled. A sneer from him, Meriadoc, is a compliment, if you feel honoured by his concern.” “Thank you!” said Merry. “But it is a greater honour to dangle at your tail, Gandalf. For one thing, in that position one has a chance of putting a question a second time. Are we riding far tonight?” Gandalf laughed. “A most unquenchable hobbit!

But I suppose it's often that way. The brave things in the old tales and songs, Mr. Frodo: adventures, as I used to call them. I used to think that they were things the wonderful folk of the stories went out and looked for, because they wanted them, because they were exciting and life was a bit dull, a kind of a sport, as you might say. But that's not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or the ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them, usually – their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn't. And if they had, we shouldn't know, because they'd have been forgotten. We hear about those as just went on – and not all to a good end, mind you at least not to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end. You know, coming home, and finding things all right, though not quite the same – like old Mr Bilbo. But those aren't always the best tales to hear, though they may be the best tales to get landed in! I wonder what sort of a tale we've fallen into?' 'I wonder,' said Frodo. 'But I don't know. And that's the way of a real tale. Take any one that you're fond of. You may know, or guess, what kind of a tale it is, happy-ending or sad-ending, but the people in it don't know. And you don't want them to.' 'No, sir, of course not. Beren now, he never thought he was going to get that Silmaril from the Iron Crown in Thangorodrim, and yet he did, and that was a worse place and a blacker danger than ours. But that's a long tale, of course, and goes on past the happiness and into grief and beyond it – and the Silmaril went on and came to Eärendil. And why, sir, I never thought of that before! We've got – you've got some of the light of it in that star-glass that the Lady gave you! Why, to think of it, we're in the same tale still! It's going on. Don't the great tales never end?'

Tinuviel was dancing there To music of a pipe unseen, And light of stars was in her hair, And in her raiment glimmering. There Beren came from mountains cold, And lost he wandered under leaves, And where the Elven-river rolled. He walked along and sorrowing. He peered between the hemlock-leaves And saw in wonder flowers of gold Upon her mantle and her sleeves, And her hair like shadow following. Enchantment healed his weary feet That over hills were doomed to roam And forth he hastened, strong and fleet, And grasped at moonbeams glistening. Through woven woods in Elvenhome She lightly fled on dancing feet, And left him lonely still to roam In the silent forest listening. He heard there oft the flying sound Of feet as light as linden-leaves, Or music welling underground, In hidden hollows quavering. Now withered lay the hemlock-sheaves, And one by one with sighing sound Whispering fell the beechen leaves In the wintry woodland wavering. He sought her ever, wandering far Where leaves of years were thickly strewn, By light of moon and ray of star In frosty heavens shivering. Her mantle glinted in the moon, As on a hill-top high and far She danced, and at her feet was strewn A mist of silver quivering. When winter passed, she came again, And her song released the sudden spring, Like rising lark, and falling rain, And melting water bubbling. He saw the elven-flowers spring About her feet, and healed again He longed by her to dance and sing Upon the grass untroubling. Again she fled, but swift he came. Tinuviel! Tinuviel! He called her by her elvish name And there she halted listening. One moment stood she, and a spell His voice laid on her: Beren came, And doom fell on Tinuviel That in his arms lay glistening. As Beren looked into her eyes Within the shadows of her hair, The trembling starlight of the skies He saw there mirrored shimmering. Tinuviel the elven-fair, Immortal maiden elven-wise, About him cast her shadowy hair And arms like silver glimmering. Long was the way that fate them bore, O'er stony mountains cold and grey, Through halls of iron and darkling door, And woods of nightshade morrowless. The Sundering Seas between them lay, And yet at last they met once more, And long ago they passed away In the forest singing sorrowless.” - The Lord of the Rings",2023-01-21 00:00:22+00:00,https://t.me/jrr_tolkien_quotes/8981,,,272,2,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[...]As they sang the hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands and by cunning and by magic moving through him, a fierce and jealous love, the desire of the hearts of dwarves. Then something Tookish woke up inside him, and he wished to go and see the great mountains, and hear the pine-trees and the waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking-stick. He looked out of the window. The stars were out in a dark sky above the trees. He thought of the jewels of the dwarves shining in dark caverns. Suddenly in the wood beyond The Water a flame leapt up - probably somebody lighting a wood-fire-and he thought of plundering dragons settling on his quiet Hill and kindling it all to flames.

In describing a fairy-story which they think adults might possibly read for their own entertainment, reviewers frequently indulge in such waggeries as: ""this book is for children from the ages of six to sixty."" But I have never yet seen the puff of a new motor-model that began thus: ""this toy will amuse infants from seventeen to seventy"" though that to my mind would be much more appropriate. Is there any essential connexion between children and fairy-stories? Is there any call for comment, if an adult reads them for himself? Reads them as tales, that is, not studies them as curios.

Yet after the fall of Sauron their power was ever at work, and where they abode there mirth also dwelt and all things were unstained by the griefs of time. Therefore ere the Third Age was ended the Elves perceived that the Ring of Sapphire was with Elrond, in the fair valley of Rivendell, upon whose house the stars of heaven most brightly shone whereas the Ring of Adamant was in the Land of Lórien where dwelt the Lady Galadriel. A queen she was of the woodland Elves, the wife of Celeborn of Doriath, yet she herself was of the Noldor and remembered the Day before days in Valinor, and she was the mightiest and fairest of all the Elves that remained in Middle-earth. But the Red Ring remained hidden until the end, and none save Elrond and Galadriel and Cirdan knew to whom it had been committed. Thus it was that in two domains the bliss and beauty of the Elves remained still undiminished while that Age endured: in Imladris and in Lothlórien, the hidden land between Celebrant and Anduin, where the trees bore flowers of gold and no Orc or evil thing dared ever come. Yet many voices were heard among the Elves foreboding that, if Sauron should come again, then either he would find the Ruling Ring that was lost, or at the best his enemies would discover it and destroy it but in either chance the powers of the Three must then fail and all things maintained by them must fade, and so the Elves should pass into the twilight and the Dominion of Men begin. And so indeed it has since befallen: the One and the Seven and the Nine are destroyed and the Three have passed away, and with them the Third Age is ended, and the Tales of the Eldar in Middle-earth draw to then-close.” - The Silmarillion",2022-09-22 16:00:25+00:00,https://t.me/jrr_tolkien_quotes/8334,,,316,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sam sat propped against the stone, his head dropping sideways and his breathing heavy. In his lap lay Frodo's head, drowned in sleep upon his white forehead lay one of Sam's brown hands, and the other lay softly upon his master's breast. Peace was in both their faces. Gollum looked at them. A strange expression passed over his lean hungry face. The gleam faded from his eyes, and they went dim and grey, old and tired. A spasm of pain seemed to twist him, and he turned away, peering back up towards the pass, shaking his head, as if engaged in some interior debate. Then he came back, and slowly putting out a trembling hand, very cautiously he touched Frodo's knee--but almost the touch was a caress. For a fleeting moment, could one of the sleepers have seen him, they would have thought that they beheld an old weary hobbit, shrunken by the years that had carried him far beyond his time, beyond friends and kin, and the fields and streams of youth, an old starved pitiable thing.” - The Two Towers",2022-09-14 16:00:29+00:00,https://t.me/jrr_tolkien_quotes/8295,,,322,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dwarves of yore made mighty spells, While hammers fell like ringing bells In places deep, where dark things sleep, In hollow halls beneath the fells. For ancient king and elvish lord There many a gleaming golden hoard They shaped and wrought, and light they caught To hide in gems on hilt of sword. On silver necklaces they strung The flowering stars, on crowns they hung The dragon-fire, in twisted wire They meshed the light of moon and sun. Far over the misty mountains cold To dungeons deep and caverns old We must away, ere break of day, To claim our long-forgotten gold. Goblets they carved there for themselves And harps of gold where no man delves There lay they long, and many a song Was sung unheard by men or elves. The pines were roaring on the height, The wind was moaning in the night. The fire was red, it flaming spread The trees like torches blazed with light.

I used to think that they were things the wonderful folk of the stories went out and looked for, because they wanted them, because they were exciting and life was a bit dull, a kind of a sport, as you might say. But that’s not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or the ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them, usually – their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn’t. And if they had, we shouldn’t know, because they’d have been forgotten. We hear about those as just went on – and not all to a good end, mind you at least not to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end. You know, coming home, and finding things all right, though not quite the same – like old Mr. Bilbo.

The light of sun and star and moon In shining lamps of crystal hewn Undimmed by cloud or shade of night There shone for ever fair and bright. There hammer on the anvil smote, There chisel clove, and graver wrote There forged was blade, and bound was hilt The delver mined, the mason built. There beryl, pearl, and opal pale, And metal wrought like fishes' mail, Buckler and corslet, axe and sword, And shining spears were laid in hoard. Unwearied then were Durin's folk Beneath the mountains music woke: The harpers harped, the minstrels sang, And at the gates the trumpets rang. The world is grey, the mountains old, The forge's fire is ashen-cold No harp is wrung, no hammer falls: The darkness dwells in Durin's halls The shadow lies upon his tomb In Moria, in Khazad-dûm. But still the sunken stars appear In dark and windless Mirrormere There lies his crown in water deep, Till Durin wakes again from sleep. -The Song of Durin”",2022-07-22 00:00:23+00:00,https://t.me/jrr_tolkien_quotes/7994,,,292,1,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It does not deny the existence of dyscatastrophe, of sorrow and failure: the possibility of these is necessary to the joy of deliverance it denies (in the face of much evidence, if you will) universal final defeat and in so far is evangelium, giving a fleeting glimpse of Joy, Joy beyond the walls of the world, poignant as grief. It is the mark of a good fairy-story, of the higher or more complete kind, that however wild its events, however fantastic or terrible the adventures, it can give to child or man that hears it, when the “turn” comes, a catch of the breath, a beat and lifting of the heart, near to (or indeed accompanied by) tears, as keen as that given by any form of literary art, and having a peculiar quality ...

Indeed only by myth-making, only by becoming 'sub-creator' and inventing stories, can Man aspire to the state of perfection that he knew before the Fall. Our myths may be misguided, but they steer however shakily towards the true harbour, while materialistic 'progress' leads only to a yawning abyss and the Iron Crown of the power of evil.”",2022-05-30 08:00:29+00:00,https://t.me/jrr_tolkien_quotes/7690,,,254,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It certainly does not destroy or even insult Reason and it does not either blunt the appetite for, nor obscure the perception of, scientific verity. On the contrary. The keener and the clearer is the reason, the better fantasy will it make. If men were ever in a state in which they did not want to know or could not perceive truth (facts or evidence), then Fantasy would languish until they were cured. If they ever get into that state (it would not seem at all impossible), Fantasy will perish, and become Morbid Delusion. For creative Fantasy is founded upon the hard recognition that things are so in the world as it appears under the sun on a recognition of fact, but not a slavery to it. So upon logic was founded the nonsense that displays itself in the tales and rhymes of Lewis Carroll.

But I suppose it's often that way. The brave things in the old tales and songs, Mr. Frodo: adventures, as I used to call them. I used to think that they were things the wonderful folk of the stories went out and looked for, because they wanted them, because they were exciting and life was a bit dull, a kind of a sport, as you might say. But that's not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or the ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them, usually – their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn't. And if they had, we shouldn't know, because they'd have been forgotten. We hear about those as just went on – and not all to a good end, mind you at least not to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end. You know, coming home, and finding things all right, though not quite the same – like old Mr Bilbo. But those aren't always the best tales to hear, though they may be the best tales to get landed in! I wonder what sort of a tale we've fallen into?' 'I wonder,' said Frodo. 'But I don't know. And that's the way of a real tale. Take any one that you're fond of. You may know, or guess, what kind of a tale it is, happy-ending or sad-ending, but the people in it don't know. And you don't want them to.' 'No, sir, of course not. Beren now, he never thought he was going to get that Silmaril from the Iron Crown in Thangorodrim, and yet he did, and that was a worse place and a blacker danger than ours. But that's a long tale, of course, and goes on past the happiness and into grief and beyond it – and the Silmaril went on and came to Eärendil. And why, sir, I never thought of that before! We've got – you've got some of the light of it in that star-glass that the Lady gave you! Why, to think of it, we're in the same tale still! It's going on. Don't the great tales never end?' 'No, they never end as tales,' said Frodo. 'But the people in them come, and go when their part's ended.

But I suppose it's often that way. The brave things in the old tales and songs, Mr. Frodo: adventures, as I used to call them. I used to think that they were things the wonderful folk of the stories went out and looked for, because they wanted them, because they were exciting and life was a bit dull, a kind of a sport, as you might say. But that's not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or the ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them, usually – their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn't. And if they had, we shouldn't know, because they'd have been forgotten. We hear about those as just went on – and not all to a good end, mind you at least not to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end. You know, coming home, and finding things all right, though not quite the same – like old Mr Bilbo. But those aren't always the best tales to hear, though they may be the best tales to get landed in! I wonder what sort of a tale we've fallen into?' 'I wonder,' said Frodo. 'But I don't know. And that's the way of a real tale. Take any one that you're fond of. You may know, or guess, what kind of a tale it is, happy-ending or sad-ending, but the people in it don't know. And you don't want them to.' 'No, sir, of course not. Beren now, he never thought he was going to get that Silmaril from the Iron Crown in Thangorodrim, and yet he did, and that was a worse place and a blacker danger than ours. But that's a long tale, of course, and goes on past the happiness and into grief and beyond it – and the Silmaril went on and came to Eärendil. And why, sir, I never thought of that before! We've got – you've got some of the light of it in that star-glass that the Lady gave you! Why, to think of it, we're in the same tale still! It's going on. Don't the great tales never end?' 'No, they never end as tales,' said Frodo. 'But the people in them come, and go when their part's ended.

It does not deny the existence of dyscatastrophe, of sorrow and failure: the possibility of these is necessary to the joy of deliverance it denies (in the face of much evidence, if you will) universal final defeat and in so far is evangelium, giving a fleeting glimpse of Joy, Joy beyond the walls of the world, poignant as grief.” - Tolkien on Fairy-stories",2022-03-04 00:00:28+00:00,https://t.me/jrr_tolkien_quotes/7238,,,244,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But I suppose it's often that way. The brave things in the old tales and songs, Mr. Frodo: adventures, as I used to call them. I used to think that they were things the wonderful folk of the stories went out and looked for, because they wanted them, because they were exciting and life was a bit dull, a kind of a sport, as you might say. But that's not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or the ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them, usually – their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn't. And if they had, we shouldn't know, because they'd have been forgotten. We hear about those as just went on – and not all to a good end, mind you at least not to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end. You know, coming home, and finding things all right, though not quite the same – like old Mr Bilbo. But those aren't always the best tales to hear, though they may be the best tales to get landed in! I wonder what sort of a tale we've fallen into?' 'I wonder,' said Frodo. 'But I don't know. And that's the way of a real tale. Take any one that you're fond of. You may know, or guess, what kind of a tale it is, happy-ending or sad-ending, but the people in it don't know. And you don't want them to.' 'No, sir, of course not. Beren now, he never thought he was going to get that Silmaril from the Iron Crown in Thangorodrim, and yet he did, and that was a worse place and a blacker danger than ours. But that's a long tale, of course, and goes on past the happiness and into grief and beyond it – and the Silmaril went on and came to Eärendil. And why, sir, I never thought of that before!

Yet after the fall of Sauron their power was ever at work, and where they abode there mirth also dwelt and all things were unstained by the griefs of time. Therefore ere the Third Age was ended the Elves perceived that the Ring of Sapphire was with Elrond, in the fair valley of Rivendell, upon whose house the stars of heaven most brightly shone whereas the Ring of Adamant was in the Land of Lórien where dwelt the Lady Galadriel. A queen she was of the woodland Elves, the wife of Celeborn of Doriath, yet she herself was of the Noldor and remembered the Day before days in Valinor, and she was the mightiest and fairest of all the Elves that remained in Middle-earth. But the Red Ring remained hidden until the end, and none save Elrond and Galadriel and Cirdan knew to whom it had been committed. Thus it was that in two domains the bliss and beauty of the Elves remained still undiminished while that Age endured: in Imladris and in Lothlórien, the hidden land between Celebrant and Anduin, where the trees bore flowers of gold and no Orc or evil thing dared ever come. Yet many voices were heard among the Elves foreboding that, if Sauron should come again, then either he would find the Ruling Ring that was lost, or at the best his enemies would discover it and destroy it but in either chance the powers of the Three must then fail and all things maintained by them must fade, and so the Elves should pass into the twilight and the Dominion of Men begin. And so indeed it has since befallen: the One and the Seven and the Nine are destroyed and the Three have passed away, and with them the Third Age is ended, and the Tales of the Eldar in Middle-earth draw to then-close.” - The Silmarillion",2022-01-27 08:00:26+00:00,https://t.me/jrr_tolkien_quotes/7042,,,262,1,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He may have meant that the way men were living and working in the twentieth century was increasing in barbarity at an alarming rate, and that the loud demonstration of this in the streets of Oxford might serve as a warning that it is not possible to preserve for long an oasis of sanity in a desert of unreason by mere fences, without actual offensive action (practical and intellectual). I fear he did not. In any case the expression 'real life' in this context seems to fall short of academic standards. The notion that motor-cars are more 'alive' than, say, centaurs or dragons is curious that they are more 'real' than, say, horses is pathetically absurd.

But that’s not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or the ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them, usually – their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn’t. And if they had, we shouldn’t know, because they’d have been forgotten. We hear about those as just went on – and not all to a good end, mind you at least not to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end.

It certainly does not destroy or even insult Reason and it does not either blunt the appetite for, nor obscure the perception of, scientific verity. On the contrary. The keener and the clearer is the reason, the better fantasy will it make. If men were ever in a state in which they did not want to know or could not perceive truth (facts or evidence), then Fantasy would languish until they were cured. If they ever get into that state (it would not seem at all impossible), Fantasy will perish, and become Morbid Delusion. For creative Fantasy is founded upon the hard recognition that things are so in the world as it appears under the sun on a recognition of fact, but not a slavery to it. So upon logic was founded the nonsense that displays itself in the tales and rhymes of Lewis Carroll.

He may have meant that the way men were living and working in the twentieth century was increasing in barbarity at an alarming rate, and that the loud demonstration of this in the streets of Oxford might serve as a warning that it is not possible to preserve for long an oasis of sanity in a desert of unreason by mere fences, without actual offensive action (practical and intellectual). I fear he did not. In any case the expression 'real life' in this context seems to fall short of academic standards.

But Sauron could not discover them, for they were given into the hands of the Wise, who concealed them and never again used them openly while Sauron kept the Ruling Ring.

He named the nameless hills and dells He drank from yet untasted wells He stooped and looked in Mirrormere, And saw a crown of stars appear, As gems upon a silver thread, Above the shadow of his head. The world was fair, the mountains tall, In Elder Days before the fall Of mighty kings in Nargothrond And Gondolin, who now beyond The Western Seas have passed away: The world was fair in Durin's Day. A king he was on carven throne In many-pillared halls of stone With golden roof and silver floor, And runes of power upon the door. The light of sun and star and moon In shining lamps of crystal hewn Undimmed by cloud or shade of night There shone for ever fair and bright. There hammer on the anvil smote, There chisel clove, and graver wrote There forged was blade, and bound was hilt The delver mined, the mason built. There beryl, pearl, and opal pale, And metal wrought like fishes' mail, Buckler and corslet, axe and sword, And shining spears were laid in hoard. Unwearied then were Durin's folk Beneath the mountains music woke: The harpers harped, the minstrels sang, And at the gates the trumpets rang. The world is grey, the mountains old, The forge's fire is ashen-cold No harp is wrung, no hammer falls: The darkness dwells in Durin's halls The shadow lies upon his tomb In Moria, in Khazad-dûm. But still the sunken stars appear In dark and windless Mirrormere There lies his crown in water deep, Till Durin wakes again from sleep. -The Song of Durin”",2021-08-29 00:00:49+00:00,https://t.me/jrr_tolkien_quotes/6226,,,241,3,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
