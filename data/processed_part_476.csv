msg_iteration.5166.user.MartinCostelloNews.post.1807,1316724028,MartinCostelloNews,1807,,"As you will be aware they have passed a law to go door to door with the vaccine. Here's some guidance. Can I ask you to pass it onto as many unvaccinated friend and family members as possible? For UK: Door to Door Visits For Injections A plan for sending teams “armed with Covid vaccines” has been announced in the UK today (25 December 2021). This is an attempt to intimidate and coerce a very large part of the population that has freely chosen not to take the experimental injection. The number is as large as 25 million people. This article helps you to handle such a visit in the best manner. WHAT’S IN THE LAW On the face of it, Section 45C of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 allows the ‘appropriate Minister’ (currently this would be Sajid Javid MP) to introduce measures for the purpose of ‘preventing, protecting against, controlling or providing a public health response’ in an epidemic or outbreak. That is the authority under which the Government passed the Regulations. However, Section 45E of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 provides that those ‘measures’ cannot include a requirement for persons to undergo ‘medical treatment’ which is defined to include vaccination. As such, there is no legal requirement to be vaccinated in the UK. Because of this, various techniques have been used to coerce people to take the experimental injection, with aggressive marketing and behavioural psychology. For UK just now!😣 This is the actual text of Section 45E:1 Medical treatment (1)Regulations under section 45B or 45C may not include provision requiring a person to undergo medical treatment. (1) https://t.co/2TlgKMkAda (2) “ Medical treatment ” includes vaccination and other prophylactic treatment. DOOR TO DOOR VACCINATIONS It is important to record the interaction if you are able to. Welcome the people and ask them all to provide photo identification and employer details which you may needed for legal purposes. If they are not prepared to give you this information, you can ask them to leave your property if you want and tell them that not leaving would be trespass and/or harassment. If, however, you want to engage with them, whether you take their name and details or not, then you can ask them the following questions: Ask them the following: 1. What risk is “Covid” to me & my age group? 2. How long have you been trained to administer an injection? 3. Are the vaccines safe? 4. Are the vaccines effective? 5. Are these vaccines currently in a trial? 6. Do the vaccines stop “infection” and “transmission”? 7. What are the list of injuries related so far to these jabs? 8. How many people have been injured or died from the jab? 9. What are the ingredients in this jab? 10. Where is the product insert with all the placebo and safety study information? 11. What level of immunity is stronger and longer lasting, natural or vaccine induced? If they do not answer or are unable to answer, then they are not giving fully informed consent/choice and you can make a formal complaint to their head office. You can also ask them to sign any paperwork you may have already prepared requiring such compensation that the person injecting you would agree to pay, this being a signifcant sum should you suffer any harm or injury. Ask them to sign it first, this being a condition of you taking the injection. Provided below is data from the Yellow Card reporting system (MHRA) for the UK showing deaths and injuries reported to date, keeping in mind this is only a fraction of the true numbers due to under-reporting. Below is to date for the European Union: EU Total to 18th December 2021 – 34,337 Covid-19 injection deaths and over 3 million injuries, reported by almost 1.3 million people per EudraVigilance Database. https://t.co/GQ1Qn2ddQt And the data below is for the US from VAERS, this can be accessed from https://t.co/mXHJCeAEcZ The table shows the days after a Covid-19 injection before a death reported to VAERS occurred.",2021-12-29 17:52:47+00:00,https://t.me/MartinCostelloNews/1807,,,10537,12,370,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaWebPage,1,https://t.co/2TlgKMkAda,t.co,Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984,"An Act to consolidate certain enactments relating to the control of disease and to the establishment and functions of port health authorities, including enactments relating to burial and cremation and to the regulation of common lodging–houses and canal boats, with amendments to give effect to recommendations of the Law Commission.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.5219.user.MartinCostelloNews.post.1754,1316724028,MartinCostelloNews,1754,,"The Government have ADMITTED that the vaccines have damaged the natural immune systems of the double jabbed. The British government has spilled the beans about that fact that once you get double jabbed, you will never again be able to acquire full natural immunity against Covid variants - or possibly any virus! So let’s watch the ‘real’ pandemic begin now! In its Week 42 “COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report,” the U.K. Health Security Agency admitted on page 23 that “N antibody levels appear to be lower in people who acquire infection following two doses of vaccination.” It goes on to explain that this antibody drop is basically permanent. What’s this mean? We know the vaccines do not stop infection or transmission of the virus (in fact, the report shows elsewhere that vaccinated adults are now being infected at much HIGHER rates than the unvaccinated). What the British are saying is they are now finding the vaccine interferes with your body’s innate ability after infection to produce antibodies against not just the spike protein but other pieces of the virus. Specifically, vaccinated people don’t seem to be producing antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein, the shell of the virus, which are a crucial part of the response in unvaccinated people. In the long term, people who take the vaccine will be far more vulnerable to any mutations in the spike protein that might come along, even if they have already been infected and recovered once, or more than once. The unvaccinated, meanwhile, will procure lasting, if not permanent, immunity to all strains of the alleged virus after being infected with it naturally even just once. Read it for yourself..

msg_iteration.5569.user.MartinCostelloNews.post.1393,1316724028,MartinCostelloNews,1393,,"My thoughts for today and two very DIFFERENT perspectives 😁 The vaccinated people are scared. They’re scared to get COVID. They’re scared someone they love might get it and possibly die from it. They were worried they might not get to travel again or see their international families. They’re not ignorant or ‘sheeple’ (I loathe that term) - they feel like they’re doing the right thing for themselves and the people around them. This may not have been an easy choice. Unfortunately they might have felt obligated to do so. They might have been scared to get the needle. While you may not agree with them, it’s important to understand WHY these people have made their choice. You may think they’re wrong, but I’m sure you’ve felt scared and afraid before. It feels terrible. We need to have compassion and empathy for people making a hard choice that’s different than yours. The unvaccinated are scared. They’re not inconsiderate monsters who thought “I’m going to try to screw over the rest of the people and not get my vaccine.” They’re worried about long term side affects. They’re worried about their immune systems. They’re afraid of how much the government is stepping in on their personal choices, freedoms and rights. They’re scared they might end up with Bells Palsy, myocarditis, shingles, blood clots, a miscarriage, a heart attack, heart palpitations, profuse unending vomiting, an autoimmune disease activation or death. They’re worried they might never see their international families again. It would be easier to get the shot. It would be nice to win a million dollars or get paid $100. But they’re too scared to do so. It isn’t easy to say no to the shot. While you may not agree with them, it’s important to understand WHY these people have made their choice. You may think they’re wrong, but I’m sure you’ve felt scared and afraid before. It feels terrible. We need to have compassion and empathy for people making a hard choice that’s different than yours. This is NOT the time to turn on each other. It is never the time to do that. Stop the divide. Come together with compassion, empathy, understanding, patience and forgiveness. Take a moment to listen without judgement. Take time to see where the others are coming from. Everyone is doing their best. Lashing out and placing blame will only make things worse. Shaming is not the way to change someone’s mind. Understanding why and having compassion is our only choice. Choose kindness, always ✨ HumanKind.

In fact, the latest data from the UK Health Security Agency indicate that the vaccinated over 30s, especially in the 40 to 60-year-old age bracket, are actually at GREATER risk of catching covid than the unvaccinated. They are therefore, presumably, also at greater risk of passing it on, given that you can't pass on a virus unless you have caught it in the first place. Which begs the question: What is the point of vaccine passports and vaccine mandates, if vaccination doesn't prevent transmission and may even increase it? 🤔 https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1027511/Vaccine-surveillance-report-week-42.pdf",2021-10-26 13:41:13+00:00,https://t.me/MartinCostelloNews/1372,,,1669,1,17,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""The two party system is an illusion of democracy and completely broken. Incompetent people get elected on the colour of their badge rather than ability. Having the only full slate of Independent candidates in the UK, our alliance is resetting our democracy to bring it back to the basics to serve the people. We are giving Swindon's silent majority a reason to come out and vote in what we regard as a referendum to say YES to end the bizarre lockdown restrictions immediately and to say NO to vaccine passports that we believe is a creeping attack on our basic liberty’s and will create a two tier social system. Our diverse candidate’s want to bring our beautifully diverse town together in harmony and build a family community for Swindon that is welcoming for all. It is now time for the left and right to unite and give the political establishment a 'bloody nose' and remind them they are here to serve us and not the other way round, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to do this. The spotlight will be on our town, let us provide that beacon of hope and liberty to the rest of the nation."" Peace, love and harmony to all.

As he enjoyed the grains, in a few days’ time, he reached the bottom of the jar. Now he is trapped and he cannot get out of it. He now has to solely depend upon someone to put grains in the same jar for him to survive. He also may not get the grain of his choice and he cannot choose either. Here are a few lessons to learn from this: 1) Short term pleasures can lead to long-term traps (living on benefits/furlough perhaps?). 2) If things are coming easy and you are getting comfortable, you are getting trapped into dependency. 3) When you are not using your skills, you will lose more than your skills. You lose your CHOICES and FREEDOM. 4) Freedom does not come easy but can be lost very quickly.

Join us as we embark on a tale which included many missing pubs of the east-end which served the grittiest of Londoner's. This is an important tale to the area's of Shadwell and Wapping as well as to the overall history on east London. We cover various locations which look similar or completely different to the scenes of 1811. This story has a dose of the macabre, the historic and the downright interesting. We hope you take as much from this film as we did by making it and once again thank all those who view and support our content as well as Britain's pubs. 🎙 @VinnieSull1van 🎥 @ChelseaDan5 With @Full_3nglish Pub Twitter: https://twitter.com/Britains___Pubs Pub Instagram: https://instagram.com/britainspubs?igshid=OGQ5ZDc2ODk2ZA== Vinnie Twitter/X: https://twitter.com/VinnieSull1van Dan Twitter/X: https://twitter.com/ChelseaDan5 Full English Twitter/X: https://twitter.com/Full_3nglish Vinnie Instagram: https://instagram.com/vinnie___sullivan?igshid=OGQ5ZDc2ODk2ZA== Vinnie Sullivan You Tube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFguhqdqRSteT0fGQLG5vqA",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Keep alight my presence in; A world I'll not return. May I be a light at night, I hope to be nocturnal, Fade me not away. I plead, Instead, make me Eternal. I hope that death permits me, Souls alone in turn. To spark an evening lantern, Beside my grave or urn. Leave me not alone to face, A lightless, empty gloom. I shall ignite as each sun sets, From my darkened tomb. May the night and shadows, Crowd my nightly flame. May I join them as they watch, So each may know my name. Flames'll flicker without wind, And though you'll never see, Stand beside my light alone, You'll know for sure, it's me. - Vin",2024-11-03 07:05:56+00:00,https://t.me/VinsFavouriteArtwork/9159,,,820,0,5,1,PeerChannel,1197278601.0,vinniesullivan,2024-11-03 04:57:54,2024-11-03,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/31491,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This perpetual sense of longing is a the result of having but one lifetime, whilst cursed with the need for achievement of the kind that will either not exist, or be humanly unreachable. 'Mountain Syndrome', is the feeling of a mountaineer desperately missing his wife and home when upon the mountain, but unable to live without the mountain when among home comforts. Comfort and greatness are so mutually unexclusive, no great man who admires either will ever know true contentment.

msg_iteration.2057.user.VinsFavouriteArtwork.post.7159,1366921559,VinsFavouriteArtwork,7159,,"The Bride of Lammermoor by John Everett Millais The Bride of Lammermoor is a tragic and historical novel by Scottish author Walter Scott. Along with A Legend of Montrose, it forms the third series of Tales of My Host. The two books appeared on the same day, June 21, 1819, under the pseudonym Jedediah Cleishbotham. Written in special conditions (the author is seriously ill), The Bride of Lammermoor differs from Scott's other historical novels: the story is not connected to any event of national importance, the period is not coherently specified, no historical figure appears, the subiect is less didactic, the supernatural holds an unusual place, the threat of fate is omnipresent and the two main characters meet a tragic end. This is Walter Scott's darkest historical novel. The story takes place in Scotland in the late 17th or early 18th century. Secretly engaged, a young girl is put under terrible family pressure to break her vows and marry another man. She gradually descends into madness. This ""story of love and death"" inspired Donizetti's famous opera Lucia di Lammermoor in 1835. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 @europeanvolk",2024-02-19 10:35:26+00:00,https://t.me/VinsFavouriteArtwork/7159,,,525,0,11,1,PeerChannel,1851216503.0,europeanvolk,2024-02-19 10:31:04,2024-02-19,https://t.me/europeanvolk/3273,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.2311.user.VinsFavouriteArtwork.post.6889,1366921559,VinsFavouriteArtwork,6889,,"A word of advice to many channels across Telegram, legal issues are a real thing in Europe. You make fantastic posts but plaster imagery which is now illegal to post or hands power to the same state you're troubled by. I'd love to be able to share more of your work and will continue to share many across my channels. I wish I could share the thoughts and statements of many more who allow classic mistakes to cloud the use of their talents. It's easy to fed-post, it's just the 4-chan system we've seen for too long. The development of of the skills requited to tackle difficult issues require practice and far more than short term endorphin chasing. If you use racial slurs it's like saying c*** in an argument, it's the avoidance of explaining one's self, to learn all that's required to properly adress and answer serious issues must be practised. If you honestly can't understand that you make it harder for those across the western world to connect, I feel you're not taking things seriously enough and see it as a game. Those of us who aren't anonymous shouldn't have to avoid or be put at risk by those who are anonymous. To fed post with those who are public is to expect them to take the blame for the things you're hiding from. This is a polite appeal to those who own grat channels and those with much to say, to consider a new approach which represents us properly as opposed to the pattern we've seen fail for years. We must know how to deal with difficult topics and that doesn't happen without work. You can dislike or attack me for saying this if you must but I can't share your work, or work with you anyway, so by saying nothing it's more damaging, especially when there's so many who could be of far more use to everyone. Inside you know this to be the case, I respect those who act online how they would in a room, remembering professionalism and respect. I met many people on march scenes and more where it's very different to anonymous voice/text chats and easier to remember you're dealing with real people. I feel too many forget that, when they mightn't have realised, or experienced, such a reality. I find it hypocritical that people will be fake in the real world (work, travelling etc) and then be rude to the few in here who they should be connecting with. We've far to go, whilst being too far behind. Loving your own isn't the same as hating others. 🤝",2024-01-19 14:21:57+00:00,https://t.me/VinsFavouriteArtwork/6889,,,578,0,4,1,PeerChannel,1197278601.0,vinniesullivan,2024-01-19 13:23:34,2024-01-19,https://t.me/vinniesullivan/27375,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The child with his primer sets out alone And speeds as if he were hunted, The wind goes by with a hollow moan-- There's a noise in the hedge-row stunted. 'Tis the turf-digger's ghost, near-by he dwells, And for drink his master's turf he sells. ""Whoo! whoo!"" comes a sound like a stray cow's groan; The poor boy's courage is daunted. Then stumps loom up beside the ditch, Uncannily nod the bushes, The boy running on, each nerve a twitch, Through a jungle of spear-grass pushes. And where it trickles and crackles apace Is the Spinner's unholy hiding-place, The home of the cursèd Spinning-witch Who turns her wheel 'mid the rushes. On, ever on, goes the fearsome rout, In pursuit through that region fenny, At each wild stride the bubbles burst out, And the sounds from beneath are many. Until at length from the midst of the din Comes the squeak of a spectral violin, That must be the rascally fiddler lout Who ran off with the bridal penny! The turf splits open, and from the hole Bursts forth an unhappy sighing, ""Alas, alas, for my wretched soul!"" 'Tis poor damned Margaret crying! The lad he leaps like a wounded deer, And were not his guardian angel near Some digger might find in a marshy knoll Where his little bleached bones were lying. But the ground grows firmer beneath his feet, And there from over the meadow A lamp is flickering homely-sweet; The boy at the edge of the shadow Looks back as he pauses to take his breath, And in his glance is the fear of death.

Take up the White Man's burden - In patience to abide To veil the threat of terror And check the show of pride; By open speech and simple, An hundred times made plain, To seek another's profit, And work another's gain. Take up the White Man's burden - The savage wars of peace - Fill full the mouth of famine And bid the sickness cease; And when your goal is nearest The end for others sought, Watch Sloth and heathen Folly Bring all your hopes to nought. Take up the White Man's burden - No tawdry rule of kings, But toil of serf and sweeper - The tale of common things. The ports ye shall not enter, The roads ye shall not tread, Go make them with your living, And mark them with your dead ! Take up the White Man's burden - And reap his old reward, The blame of those ye better, The hate of those ye guard - The cry of hosts ye humour (Ah slowly !) towards the light:- ""Why brought ye us from bondage, ""Our loved Egyptian night ?"" Take up the White Man's burden - Ye dare not stoop to less - Nor call too loud on Freedom To cloak your weariness; By all ye cry or whisper, By all ye leave or do, The silent sullen peoples Shall weigh your Gods and you. Take up the White Man's burden - Have done with childish days - The lightly proffered laurel, The easy, ungrudged praise. Comes now, to search your manhood Through all the thankless years, Cold-edged with dear-bought wisdom, The judgement of your peers.",2022-11-17 17:20:44+00:00,https://t.me/VinsFavouriteArtwork/3710,,,4271,0,73,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
