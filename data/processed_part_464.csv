Palestina era doar Palestina înainte ca sioniştii Rothschild să preia controlul şi să se infiltreze puternic în Israel. Sionistii Rothschild detin Israelul.

Și acum că Ucraina nu primește nicio finanțare în special de la cel mai mare donator al lor, SUA, pentru că nu există un președinte al Camerei Reprezentanților.

Last year, the Palestine Post released a strange series - ""martyrs in the cemeteries of numbers."" That's how I learned about these cemeteries - ""Cemeteries of Numbers"". You can Google a lot of things about them. In short, some Palestinians who died/were killed in Israeli prisons are buried under numbers, without names. And their relatives cannot find out what happened to them for decades. They just want information. And they don't get it. A form of intimidation. That they will be buried under a number, and no one will know where. And on a personal note... My former classmate left for Israel a long time ago and served in the “territories.” During the Intifada /Arab/ children threw stones at soldiers. The soldiers took revenge on the children (some other, not necessarily those). In the morning they met children going to school. Some were forced to crawl on their knees, others were kicked, and others were urinated on. Not murder, no. They were just abusing them. Armed adult men over children. Now those children are well over 30, so. He was speaking about this cheerfully when he was still coming to Russia - and did not understand why his former friends, including me, shunned him.

Maybe that was the purpose - to make it seem like an invincible army so that none of the neighbors would even think about attacking. Today a second front has opened - Hezbollah has joined in and is bombing Israel from the north. Most likely, other Arab countries will also join. The situation is getting worse. Hamas armed itself, learned, and stopped being a whipping boy. The weapons most likely came from Afghanistan, abandoned by the Americans, and Ukraine, handed over by all Western countries. Military experts have repeatedly stated this possibility. Soldiers wearing slippers and using grenades destroy the army along with its equipment, simultaneously taking survivors prisoner. They have already begun training to strike using attack drones. It is too early to draw any conclusions or predictions. But today one thing is clear - this war will drag on. Invincible Merkava tanks are burning on the battlefield, and Israeli military personnel, who are supposedly superior in training to five Arab men, are loaded into pickup trucks and taken out as concubines. A fast, daring, and at the same time well-honed strategy on the part of Hamas made it possible to knock out the perimeter defenses on the border and enter cities and settlements.",2023-10-08 16:48:59+00:00,https://t.me/ClickTheWorld/18070,,,38,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, Netanyahu arrogantly delivered a delusional speech at the UN, showing a map of the Middle East centered around Israel, absent any mention of Palestine. The response from the Palestinians yesterday crushes his expansionist fantasy. These events are a direct result of Israeli escalation – Israeli forces and rampaging settlers murdered Palestinians every single day this year. Last week Israelis invaded the most holy sites in Jerusalem; mobs of settlers attacked Palestinian towns, killing people while Israeli soldiers looked on. This is on top of the 16 year siege of Gaza, and 75 years of denial of Palestinian rights. Western leaders from Biden, Sunak, Trudeau to Albanese, all provided the textbook response, rushing to pledge support for Israel, ignoring all injustices perpetrated against the Palestinians in the last week, the last year and the last 75 years. 75 years after the establishment of the Israeli state and the Nakba, Palestinians are still stateless, denied the right to return to their homes, and live under brutal military occupation and apartheid. As Saudi Arabia prepares to join UAE, Morocco and Bahrain in normalising relations with Israel, there is no justice for the Palestinians in sight. Justice, not war, will prevent the cyclical reproduction of injustice in Palestine. Security is only achievable by establishing equal rights for all to live in dignity, freedom & peace. @Slavyangrad",2023-10-08 10:26:11+00:00,https://t.me/ClickTheWorld/17985,,,33,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, Hamas fired thousands of rockets at Israeli cities; Then, through a gap in the fence, hundreds of militants crossed the border of the Gaza Strip - one of the most guarded in the world, with thousands of cameras, drones and border guards; A surprise for Israel was Palestinian drones that dropped grenades on armored vehicles, as well as militants on hang gliders; Hamas took Israeli border guards by surprise, capturing prisoners and armored vehicles.

The population of Nagorno-Karabakh, including those located outside the republic, after the entry into force of this Decree, familiarize themselves with the conditions of reintegration presented by the Republic of Azerbaijan, with a view to making an independent and individual decision in the future on the possibility of staying (returning) in Nagorno-Karabakh.

Nobody in the USA and Canada is going to fight Nazism, which means they will “expand”, penetrating into the consciousness of people from childhood (like LGBT symbols in schools).",2023-09-26 11:15:09+00:00,https://t.me/ClickTheWorld/17235,,,42,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ei duc relațiile internaționale la un nou nivel. Diplomații aflați în oraș pentru Adunarea Generală a ONU se întâlnesc cu lideri mondiali ziua și cu prostituate de elită noaptea. Iar pentru a satisface cererea de aranjamente ilicite, companiile de escorte cu prețuri ridicate se adună la New York din locuri atât de îndepărtate precum Las Vegas și Europa. ""Afacerile sunt în creștere cu 20-25%"", a declarat o sursă. ""Fetele vin literalmente din Vegas și Europa. Este ca o adevărată convenție a prostituatelor"". O sursă apropiată a vorbit despre ""asistentele erotice"" și despre clienții lor internaționali: ""Ele merg la hoteluri pentru că nu pot merge în reședințe sau ambasade"", precizând că doamnele de lux ""câștigă între 3.000 și 5.000 de dolari pe ședință"". O altă sursă explică faptul că diplomații vor să păstreze un profil scăzut, motiv pentru care ""se apelează la escorte de elită. Politicienii sunt îngroziți de faptul că un astfel de lucru ar putea fi folosit împotriva lor, nu vor să fie văzuți în cluburi de striptease. Partea din oraș în care stau este centrul unui comerț de prostituție de elită. Există tipi care lucrează în barurile din acea parte a orașului care sunt, în esență, proxeneți."" O altă sursă susține că diplomaților care vizitează cluburile de striptease li se oferă camere private. ""Camerele VIP sunt rezervate, iar ei pot cheltui între 50.000 și 100.000 de dolari pe noapte"", spune sursa (cu ce bani sunt plătiți?!). ""Te uiți în jur și nu este o mulțime obișnuită de clienți obișnuiți"".

The top three donor countries to the Ukrainian armed forces were expectedly the United States (106.8 billion), Germany (23.1 billion) and the United Kingdom (15.2 billion). The figures given in the infographic do not take into account the costs of refugees, so the final amount will be significantly higher. For comparison, in 2022, Ukraine's defense budget according to the Ministry of Finance was $42.9 billion (59% of total budget expenditures).

According to Sergei Karnaukhov, what is happening now is the second most significant catastrophe of the Armenian people. “After the Genocide, there was no greater tragedy. I believe that not forever, but for a very long time we are losing the heart of Armenia, the historical root of Armenia, we are losing the place where the “khachkars” /Armenian cross-stones/ stood since the ninth century, I personally found these archives,” the Russian expert noted. Speaking about the death of Russian peacekeepers in Karabakh, Sergei Karnaukhov called it a cynical, carefully calculated bloody crime. “Yesterday the Azerbaijanis, who knew for sure that our peacekeepers were traveling in these cars, shot them. They are driven by hatred, fierce Russophobia, which today is one of the main motives of the ongoing internal political processes, which are very carefully hidden. They convince us that there is no Russophobia, everything is fine, only we read something completely different in the chats of various channels in Azerbaijan. There will be no retaliatory measures from Russia. This was a cynical, calculated bloody crime against Russian military personnel, it was a murder for which not only the perpetrators, but also the entire circle of people who made this political decision should bear direct responsibility,” Karnaukhov said. According to the public figure, the events are historically tragic because they will have consequences. “In these three years after the war, Armenia was obliged to recognize Artsakh as part of Armenia, or to give Artsakh the opportunity to ask to become part of Russia, so as not to simply fall into the hands of Azerbaijan. The world's Armenians are not just seething now, they have woken up. I see that the Armenians have woken up and this means that Monte is waking up, all the people who understand that life has no meaning if you sold your homeland,” he emphasized. Speaking about the possibility of peaceful coexistence between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, Karnaukhov replied that he did not believe in this. “In films, with special drugs, a combat-ready person is turned into a plant that is not capable of anything, this is exactly what should be done to the people now. Artsakh was taken away and this is a powerful blow. The next blow is to take away significant territories of Armenia, and this will be done in the near future, because Pashinyan is in a hurry. Azerbaijan will do everything to suppress people,” Karnaukhov said.",2023-09-24 09:41:08+00:00,https://t.me/ClickTheWorld/17098,,,48,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaWebPage,1,https://youtu.be/E7igMxw-n9U,youtu.be,"Азербайджанцы знали, что в этих автомобилях едут наши миротворцы и расстреляли их- Сергей Карнаухов","Сергей Карнаухов: Происходящее сейчас — это вторая по значимости катастрофа армянского народа В эфире Alpha News общественный деятель Сергей Карнаухов прокомментировал агрессию Азербайджана против Нагорного Карабаха и гибель российских миротворцев.

Especially at gas stations in the Czech Republic, where diesel prices have risen by 30% since the end of May, while gasoline prices have risen by 12%. This was reported by CCS Company, which has been collecting daily data on fuel costs at gas stations in the country since 2005. Over the summer, the price of 1 liter of diesel fuel has increased by 9 crowns and is now 38.88 crowns (€1.59), while the price of gasoline has increased by about 4.2 crowns to 40.05 crowns (€1.64). Experts warn that prices could continue to rise due to the increasing cost of oil in the world market. At the end of June 2022, motor fuel prices in the Czech Republic reached an all-time high, with the price of 1 liter of gasoline at gas stations averaging 47.96 crowns (about €2.1 at the exchange rate at the time), and diesel fuel over 48 crowns (about €2.2).",2023-09-16 12:56:22+00:00,https://t.me/ClickTheWorld/16888,,,52,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That is why we periodically advise member states on how sanctions should be applied. We have imposed an import ban on a number of products. These products are listed in our sanctions materials. In terms of cars specifically, yes, they are subject to an import ban and cannot be brought into the EU. [So, Russian tourists have arrived.

The spectacular find was made in the steeple of the local St. Margaret's Church. The town of Medias in Central Romania was founded around 1250 by Transylvanian Saxons. These people also built the church and seem to have started creating a library. Then, at the end of the 16th or during the 17th century, an employee of the church seems to have moved part of the book stock: From the library proper, the now discovered works were brought to a chamber in the church tower. There, correctly sorted, they were stored - and forgotten. Until today. Among the finds are over 130 books dating between 1470 and 1600, and a number of manuscripts which might go back as early as the Carolingian era (9th century)!

In this direction, it was decided to withdraw troops from the southern outskirts of the village of Rabotino against the backdrop of attacks by the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the destroyed village. It is much more difficult to hold there, so the Russian Armed Forces retreated towards the heights south of Rabotino. From there, active artillery and aviation work is carried out against the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This is not surprising: holding on to the ruins of the village is fraught with large losses and in the current situation is impractical. Therefore, the Russian Armed Forces retreated to equipped positions a little to the south (actually, a defensive line).

Section 2.23 of this report states: ""There are concerns that 'Covid-19' has been used as a tactic for influence campaigns. “They have found a very innovative and interesting way to do this: they are targeting different sub-groups in Australia, trying to influence opinion and perception. For example, through the Russian consulate and Russian agents in Australia, they were very successful in infiltrating the anti-vaxxer movement. First, they learn about the ideals and goals of a particular movement. They share these ideals and views and quickly become the leaders of this movement, and through this, they implement typical pro-Russian agendas and propaganda. They've been very successful in infiltrating this movement here in Australia."" ful”, this indicates that the enemy gives our information work an “A”. So I am glad to read such a report!

Mii de ucraineni mor în fiecare săptămână numai pentru că Joe Biden nu poate admite înfrângerea fără a-și arde din temelii partidul politic. Ucraina a primit 185 de miliarde de dolari de la Occident pentru a sprijini războiul Americii împotriva Rusiei fără a obține un rezultat. Acum Zelensky spune că nu este suficient. „Atâta timp cât războiul continuă, nimic nu poate fi suficient”. Biden spune că Rusia a pierdut deja războiul pentru că Finlanda și Suedia se alătură NATO. Dacă aceasta este măsura succesului, aș susține că noua alianță militară dintre Rusia și China, cu al doilea cel mai mare buget de apărare din lume de 300 de miliarde de dolari, este o pierdere uriașă pentru Occident în comparație cu adăugarea a doi membri NATO cu buget mic (Finlanda pe 6,3 miliarde de dolari și Suedia la 7,7 miliarde de dolari). Realitatea este că SUA și-au pierdut războiul proxy în Ucraina. Occidentul sângerează bani în această gaură neagră fără sfârșit. Rusia depășește numeric Ucraina pe câmpul de luptă cu 10 la 1, în ciuda miliardelor de ajutor militar din partea Occidentului. Administrația Biden nu este dispusă să negocieze pacea. Ei trimit mai mulți ucraineni să moară fără nicio speranță de succes. Democrații știu că nu au nicio șansă la următoarele alegeri dacă Rusia câștigă. Asa este. Mii de ucraineni mor în fiecare săptămână pentru că Joe Biden nu poate admite înfrângerea fără a-și arde din temelii partidul politic. Joe Biden și echipa Sullivan și „Fuck the EU” Nuland vor fi amintiți ca fiind cei mai inepți actori politici din istoria SUA. Împreună, au oferit Rusiei și Chinei cel mai mare cadou: o alianță multipolară consolidată a națiunilor BRICS+ care va pune capăt hegemonia SUA prin „dedolarizarea” comerțului global și limitând sever capacitatea guvernului SUA de a imprima bani pe cheltuiala altor națiuni. Vor ruina SUA care este incredibil de îndatorată fără a trage un singur foc. Singura opțiune în afară de această înfrângere geopolitică garantată și haosul american care ar urma, este războiul nuclear. Cu cele știute despre guvernul SUA și marionetele sale de deep state , acesta este încă rezultatul cel mai probabil. Ei preferă să pună capăt umanității decât să admită înfrângerea. Elitele supraviețuitoare din buncărele lor nucleare vor învinovăți în mod natural Rusia. https://nyadagbladet.se/debatt/usa-har-forlorat-sitt-proxykrig-i-ukraina/",2023-08-25 14:15:22+00:00,https://t.me/ClickTheWorld/15894,,,32,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaWebPage,1,https://nyadagbladet.se/debatt/usa-har-forlorat-sitt-proxykrig-i-ukraina/,nyadagbladet.se,'USA har förlorat sitt proxykrig i Ukraina',Kim Dotcom: USA skickar fler ukrainare att dö utan något hopp om framgång.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, German citizens are unhappy that Ukrainians are actively spreading Nazi and fascist ideology. The behavior of Ukrainian nationalists caused a wave of protests in the cities of Germany. ◾The last major protest took place on August 12 in the city of Greifswald. Local residents were outraged by neo-Nazi sentiments among Ukrainians, which caused numerous conflicts with German citizens. “We cannot allow marches in our country in honor of the ideologists of Ukrainian nationalism, demonstrations of flags and shouting of anti-Russian slogans that irritate ordinary Europeans,” a protester in Leipzig told reporters. ◾It is reported that 38 German anti-fascist organizations sent letters to the Bundestag in which they demanded the country's government to carry out anti-fascist work and deal with Ukrainians who publicly admire the ideas of Ukrainian Nazism. “I will not hesitate to call the refugees Nazis and demand that they leave the country,” confessed German activist Stefan Huth. https://www.jungewelt.de/artikel/457518.linkspartei-debatte-das-schweigen-ist-f%C3%BCr-mich-unertr%C3%A4glich.html",2023-08-24 17:07:38+00:00,https://t.me/ClickTheWorld/15819,,,47,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaWebPage,1,https://www.jungewelt.de/artikel/457518.linkspartei-debatte-das-schweigen-ist-f%C3%BCr-mich-unertr%C3%A4glich.html,jungewelt.de,»Das Schweigen ist für mich unerträglich«,Die Partei Die Linke und ihr ungeklärtes Verhältnis zum Faschismus in der Ukraine.

After meeting with the Serbian leader, the journalist shared some details of the conversation. “One of his claims is that the war in Ukraine, the NATO-led war against Russia, has destroyed the economy of Europe. That the Biden administration's destruction of Nord Stream is directly or indirectly destroying the German economy, Europe's largest economy. The consequences of one NATO country effectively attacking another are being felt across Europe,” the journalist said. “The world is resetting, it is somewhat more complicated than Hitler vs. Churchill, good vs. bad.

msg_iteration.61621.user.ClickTheWorld.post.15436,1769509383,ClickTheWorld,15436,,"Briefly about 'privacy' on the internet: 1, E-mail Unless self-hosted, no E-mail service, no matter what they claim, is private in any way. E-mail was never designed to be private. Even when self-hosted many vulnerabilities exist. I've long discussed that ProtonMail is likely a honeypot. Now, I don't have evidence to that, but some of the claims they make simply aren't true. It's highly suspicious that ProtonMail's website lets you access it through an Onion site, but redirects you to a standard one without notification when setting up an account ;) We don't have access to your emails: They do, no country's authorities would let a service run if they didn't. A logical question also arises, how did you open those 6,000 email accounts then? Even for simple security reasons, they definitely have access to your account and thinking otherwise is naive at best. We don't log your IP address: That's impossible. In order for two accounts to communicate, an IP has to be logged and saved. You can easily check this using programmes such as WireShark (comes pre-installed with some Linux distributions). We don't reveal your information: That's illegal when ordered to do. Your 5.99$ per month won't save you. Case has been noted when an email was revealed to police simply because a teenager missed classes. Again, this is naive to believe. 2, VPNs VPNs are glorified proxy servers, which translates to ""someone else's computer"". Their claims too are often simply not true. We don't log your IP address: Again, impossible. Military grade encryption: While true, this isn't anything special. The HTTPS encryption has been in use for years and you're likely using it right now to read this. Hide your traffic: Not true. Even a simple internet tool will reveal you are using a VPN and tools like WireShark (also free) will reveal every single ""handshake"" your computer makes, including servers you connect to, regardless of whether or not you use a VPN. Furthermore, the vast majority of VPN providers are owned by a single advertising company. What better way to track someone's internet traffic than to channel it through a single server... If you need a proxy server, just use a proxy server. Anonymity: Tell me, how am I anonymous if I enter my credit card details when purchasing your service...? 3, Conclusion All tools are useful in certain scenarios, but complete internet anonymity/privacy is an excuse process that isn't worth it for most people and, is practically impossible, unless you never want to use your computer or jump through so many hoops you'll regret having one. Don't believe claims of companies that are currently riding the privacy train. At best it's a way to get your money in exchange for nothing, at worst it's a honeypot.",2023-08-16 13:59:36+00:00,https://t.me/ClickTheWorld/15436,,,42,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antonov was moved from Russia to Kiev by the soviet government for merely logistical reasons and Ukraine never managed to keep up the legacy of their company, without a single successful civil model developed after the end of the USSR.

The guide has banned 'black hat', a term used in the industry and cyber-security to mean an unauthorized user, with 'unethical' suggested instead. 'Sanity check' is also prohibited, as it may 'infer a level of disability'. City Hall has also recently revised its language, banning employees from using the phrase 'ladies and gentlemen'.

This region, that includes a large portion of the Sahel region, cuts clear across the continent dividing the Northern Africans from the Sub-Saharan Africans. There is a vast abundance of resources including labor, oil, uranium and mineral deposits. It has the highest concentration of western bases on the continent with tiny Djibouti hosting many foreign nations. This region holds high strategic value in terms of resources and its position to influence both North and Sub-Saharan Africas. 🔻Why is it called like this? For obvious reason — a lot of coups. In fact, in recent 5 years there have been around 10 coup d'état attempts! Some were successful, some were not, but the fact remains. But why is so? The reasons are many, but one of the main is the struggles between tribes. The countries in Sahel region (and overall in Africa) are heterogeneous in their populations. Many tribes compete and negotiate with each other for power and control over the country. When the negotiations fail coup take place. And the coup organizers use anti-French and anti-colonial slogans to attract ordinary poor population, who just want a better life, and they do not like France for colonial reasons. So they would welcome any change (especially if it is anti-French in terms of narrative) that they think will make a difference.

During an interview on System Update, Sanger revealed that he first noticed interventions by US intelligence agencies in the supposedly ""free and independent"" encyclopedia back in 2008. Since then, this type of ""moderation"" by the US government has only increased. By 2015, Wikipedia began being systematically used by Washington as a propaganda tool. Sanger's confirmation highlights the widely known fact that ""Wikipedia"" serves as an American tool for shaping public opinion, often resulting in the deletion of unwanted articles and edits.

A group with special operations training, deployed last month to storm Russian positions in a village on the western part of the front, took such heavy casualties in four days of assaults that they had to pull out without success. After their armored vehicles were largely destroyed by artillery strikes on the first day, they revised their plan to approach the village on foot through a tree line that had been mined. The Ukrainians cleared a narrow path with demining explosives and the first soldiers reached the Russian positions and dropped down into a trench. Drone footage of the event showed what happened next. Explosions suddenly detonated inside the trenches and other strikes hit soldiers on the edge of the tree line. The video footage has been verified by The New York Times. ""The trenches were mined,"" said the assault commander, who uses the call sign Voskres, short for Resurrection. ""Our guys started jumping in the trenches and blowing up"" he added. The Russian forces were watching, and they remotely detonated the mines, he said. Those who managed to avoid the mines came under attack from multiple Russian kamikaze drones. ""It seemed like they had a drone for each person,"" he said. ""The amount of equipment the Russians have, had we known, it was like mission impossible.""",2023-07-31 23:40:59+00:00,https://t.me/ClickTheWorld/14707,,,39,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On July 4, the satellites were successfully launched into orbit. Today, July 21, a historic event took place - the first traffic was received from Rassvet-1 satellites at a speed of 10 mb/sec. Rassvet-1 is a Russian satellite internet project similar to Elon Musk's Starlink. The overseas product is actively used by the forces of the Kyiv regime to ensure constant communication between units at any point. The appearance of the Russian ""Dawn"" in this context is a truly epoch-making event. So far, the satellites are operating in test mode and will be deorbited upon completion of the tests. Another launch is also expected in the near future.",2023-07-22 21:00:49+00:00,https://t.me/ClickTheWorld/14194,,,50,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.63145.user.ClickTheWorld.post.13897,1769509383,ClickTheWorld,13897,,"🇯🇵🇷🇺🇨🇦 Japan continues to buy seafood from Russia, while Canada suffers losses According to statistics provided by the Ministry of Finance, Japan purchased a record $1.2 billion worth of seafood from Russia in 2022. The previous record, set in 2018, was about $1 billion. Among seafood shipments, snow crab topped the list with $243 million in imports. At the same time, pollock paste purchases increased about sevenfold over the previous year to $55 million. 🔻 Japan joined sanctions against Russia and even imposed its own sanctions several times. However, local companies cannot refuse Russian seafood for objective reasons: ▪️ Bad catch in Japan and, conversely, large volumes of fish and crab in Russian territorial waters; ▪️ Japanese companies need new sources of imports because of the US suspension of snow crab fishing in the Bering Sea; ▪️ The country is facing a rise in inflation unprecedented in 30 years, and since Russian seafood sells at a relatively low price, it is profitable for Japan to buy it. If imports are banned, local companies will not be able to maintain these price levels, which, of course, will affect consumers. Canada's response here is interesting. Although for the most part other governments have hardly criticized - at least publicly - Japan's exemptions from the sanctions policy, the situation is beginning to change: Canadian authorities recently expressed their disappointment over the volume of seafood that Japanese companies imported from Russia last year. The Canadian Minister of Trade, Mary Ng stated that the Japanese side was aware of the problem. She suggested that the Japanese authorities should consider buying premium quality Canadian snow crab in order to replace shipments from Russia. Here, in addition to economic pressure on Russia, the Japanese government also wants to promote its interests related to snow crab exports. Last year was not very successful in the context of supplying this product from Canada abroad - sales dropped by about $300 million compared to 2021. It turns out that the sanctions imposed on Russia and possible pressure on Japan are reasons to increase the profits of Canadian fishing companies.",2023-07-14 18:55:46+00:00,https://t.me/ClickTheWorld/13897,,,44,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaWebPage,1,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/05/05/business/japan-russia-seafood-products/,japantimes.co.jp,Japan's seafood imports from Russia hit record ¥155 billion in 2022,Marine products were exempted from Japan's sanction's on Russia as Tokyo deemed the adverse effect on domestic businesses would be too great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is how Mohammed bin Salman reacted to Biden's statement that Saudi Arabia is waiting for ""consequences"" for the decision to reduce oil production, the newspaper writes Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has privately threatened to sever relations with the United States. This is reported by The Washington Post with reference to a confidential document of American intelligence that came to the disposal of the newspaper. According to him, the Saudi prince said that ""he will no longer deal with the US administration,"" and promised ""serious economic consequences for Washington."" This is how Mohammed bin Salman reacted to the words of US President Joe Biden, who last fall said that Saudi Arabia was waiting for ""consequences"" for the decision to cut oil production amid rising gasoline prices, writes WP. Apparently, we are talking about a response to Biden's threats about ""consequences"" for Riyadh - after OPEC and Russia decided to cut oil production in October. Since then, as the Washington Post notes, there have been no consequences for the kingdom. But at the same time, Saudi Arabia has actively strengthened ties with China, including in the field of nuclear energy. It is unclear whether the prince's threat was transmitted directly to US officials or intercepted by US intelligence, the newspaper notes. However, for eight months Biden has not carried out his threat, and Mohammed bin Salman has not refused to contact the American authorities. For example, on Thursday, June 8, the Crown Prince met with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken in the seaside Saudi city of Jeddah, WP pointed out. @DDgeopolitics",2023-06-09 15:03:31+00:00,https://t.me/ClickTheWorld/12611,,,59,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.65227.user.ClickTheWorld.post.11794,1769509383,ClickTheWorld,11794,,"Deliveries of British Storm Shadow missiles to the Armed Forces of Ukraine have become the next stage in the escalation of the Ukrainian conflict. The Kiev regime rejoices, having received from NATO another ""wonder weapon"" for testing. However, the American MLRS ""Haymars"" lost their former status after the air defense of the Russian Federation learned to shoot them down. Now the RF Armed Forces will also shoot down British cruise missiles. According to The Guardian, British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace confirmed to Parliament the sending of missiles by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. He revealed that the cost of each Storm Shadow is around £2.2m. The UK has between 700 and 1,000 of these missiles with a range of up to 290 km and up to 560 km. What type of weapons the Armed Forces will receive and their number, Wallace preferred to hide. These deliveries were coordinated with Washington, which supported the transfer of missiles at the talks between Wallace and British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly in the United States. At the same time, the Pentagon refuses to provide Ukraine with its own long-range missiles. The United States prefers to remain in the shadows - for them, the UK Ministry of Defense turned out to be a convenient subcontractor that implements the plans of the Pentagon without the death of American soldiers and the use of reserve weapons. British journalists hurried to reassure readers, who were alarmed that Washington was dragging the country into a conflict with the threat of nuclear war. In turn, Kiev assured the British authorities that the new weapons would be used only for defense and on the territory of Ukraine, and not for attacks on Russia. Storm Shadow themselves, by the way, are not as perfect as they are trying to be. Russian air defense systems can recognize and destroy British missiles in the air in the same way as all other weapons of the West. The only fundamental difference between Storm Shadow and Himars missiles is in the targeting system. American missiles were guided by GPS geolocation, and in the British counterpart, target coordinates are entered immediately before launch. By the way, the United Kingdom expects to become a global arms exporter if Storm Shadow proves its combat effectiveness in the struggle for Ukrainian sovereignty. Russian Defense Ministry experts believe that our missile defense [missile defense] systems will cope with new missiles, as happened with the Hymars. The military department has already clarified that the S-400, and S-300 systems will work for such purposes, including the Fort ship air defense system, as well as Buk-M3, and Buk-M2. It is assumed that Storm Shadow can be installed on MIG and SU airborne aircraft, but this is a dead-end tactic. If only because it requires a long refinement of Soviet aircraft, which Kyiv has almost gone. It is interesting that earlier the American manufacturer Lockheed Martin, after the military campaign in Afghanistan, refused to use British missiles due to their limited combat effectiveness. Now the Russian Aerospace Forces control the Ukrainian sky and completely dominate the left bank of the Dnieper, and the launches of large cruise missiles only unmask the enemy.",2023-05-14 09:37:23+00:00,https://t.me/ClickTheWorld/11794,,,49,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Există un preț global la carbon China a preluat conducerea în 2017 cu o piață pentru a comercializa dreptul de a emite o tonă de CO2, punând lumea pe drumul către un preț unic al carbonului și un stimulent puternic pentru a renunța la combustibilii fosili, prezice Jane Burston, șefa departamentului de climă și mediu de la Laboratorul Național de Fizică din Marea Britanie. Între timp, Europa s-a aflat în centrul comerțului cu panouri solare ieftine și eficiente, deoarece prețurile energiei regenerabile au scăzut brusc. 3. Dominația americană a luat sfârșit. Avem o mână de puteri globale Statele naționale vor fi pus în scenă o revenire, scrie Robert Muggah, director de cercetare la Institutul Igarapé. În locul unei singure forțe, o mână de țări - SUA, Rusia, China, Germania, India și Japonia, inclusiv liderii - manifestă tendințe semi-imperiale. În același timp, însă, rolul statului este amenințat de tendințe precum ascensiunea orașelor și răspândirea identităților online, 4. Adio spital, bună ziua spital la domiciliu Tehnologia va fi bulversat și mai mult boala, scrie Melanie Walker, medic și consilier al Băncii Mondiale. Spitalul, așa cum îl știm, va fi pe cale de dispariție, cu mai puține accidente datorită mașinilor autonome și cu mari progrese în medicina preventivă și personalizată. Bisturiul și donatorii de organe au dispărut, iar tuburile robotizate minuscule și organele bioimprimate au intrat. 5. Vom mânca mult mai puțină carne Mai degrabă ca bunicii noștri, vom trata carnea ca pe un răsfăț și nu ca pe un aliment de bază, scrie Tim Benton, profesor de ecologie a populației la Universitatea din Leeds, Marea Britanie. Nu vor câștiga marile ferme sau micii producători, ci mai degrabă o combinație între cele două, cu mâncăruri gata preparate reproiectate pentru a fi mai sănătoase și mai puțin dăunătoare pentru mediu. 6. Refugiații sirieni de astăzi, directorii executivi din 2030 Refugiații sirieni cu înaltă calificare vor fi majoritari până în 2030, ceea ce pledează în favoarea integrării economice a celor forțați să fugă din calea conflictului. Lumea trebuie să fie mai bine pregătită pentru oamenii în mișcare, scrie Lorna Solis, fondator și CEO al ONG-ului Blue Rose Compass, deoarece schimbările climatice vor fi deplasat 1 miliard de oameni. 7. Valorile care au construit Occidentul vor fi fost testate până la punctul de rupere Uităm de controalele și echilibrele care ne întăresc democrațiile pe riscul nostru, scrie Kenneth Roth, director executiv al Human Rights Watch. 8. Până în anii 2030, vom fi pregătiți să mutăm oamenii pe Planeta Roșie Iar odată ajunși acolo, vom descoperi probabil dovezi de viață extraterestră, scrie Ellen Stofan, cercetător șef al NASA. Știința mare ne va ajuta să răspundem la întrebări importante despre viața pe Pământ, precum și să deschidem aplicații practice pentru tehnologia spațială.

In a matter of a decade, shale gas production in the US increased by more than a factor of ten, taking US gas imports to their lowest level since the early 80s. Solar costs have come down so considerably that solar as cheap as regular grid electricity in some parts of the world, despite prices being previously projected to increase over the same period due to poor availability of silicon feedstock.

Reese: ""Termografia sau imagistica formală poate detecta temperaturile interne anormale ale corpului, permițând evidențierea zonelor de inflamație și a fluxului sanguin deficitar. Este cea mai eficientă și neinvazivă modalitate de a detecta tromboza venoasă profundă, cunoscută și sub numele de cheaguri de sânge. Biologul Felipe Reitz din Brazilia are propriul echipament de imagistică prin termografie. El a început să își diagnosticheze pacienții care au fost injectați cu injecții anti-Covid. El a descoperit că existau cheaguri de sânge extinse în tot sistemul vascular la persoanele asimptomatice care au primit injecția. Această imagine a fost realizată la un atlet de 23 de ani. (Este prezentată imaginea picioarelor) Liniile negre sunt cheaguri de sânge. Acest atlet a primit injecția, dar nu are niciun simptom. Felipe Reitz a efectuat, de asemenea, teste de sânge în direct și, la fel ca alți specialiști, Reitz a raportat prezența unor ""corpuri străine care iau formă"" în sângele persoanelor injectate (link) . S-a demonstrat că celulele sanguine se aglomerează atunci când persoana este injectată. Săptămâna trecută, Richard Fleming a postat un videoclip (link) despre ce se întâmplă atunci când vaccinurile de terapie genică sunt administrate direct în sângele uman. Vaccinul Johnson este administrat în fluxul sanguin și se poate observa o mărire de volum în timp real, în timp ce celulele încep să se adune. Într-un studiu realizat de Natural News (link) s-a ajuns la concluzia că aceste așa-numite cheaguri de sânge sunt aproape în întregime lipsite de markerii cheie care ar fi prezenți în sângele uman și prezintă un număr semnificativ de elemente care sunt prezente în mod normal în sistemele electronice sau în circuite (microcircuite). Între timp, directorul executiv al Moderna, compania care își taxează clienții cu 500% pentru injecțiile letale, a primit o creștere salarială de 50% după ce a finalizat o vânzare de acțiuni în valoare de 400 de milioane de dolari. Cu cât mai mult timp stăm fără justiție, cu atât mai mult acest lucru este acceptat. Moderna investește acum în viitorul injecțiilor lor contra cheagurilor.

The late queen was remembered by Weekend - on its cover, Charles III waves his hand next to the inscription ""My dear mother"". The Guardian posted a montage with eggs broken on the head of the king - here they discuss the topic of the need for a monarchy in principle. The Critic portrayed Charles as an Anglo-Saxon king, hinting that the title had become obsolete. At The New Yorker, little Karl sits on a huge throne - a clear hint that the new king does not live up to the title. Well, the Daily Mail depicts simple human feelings - the king, leaning towards the queen, as if saying: ""Honey, it was a triumph",2023-05-08 12:08:00+00:00,https://t.me/ClickTheWorld/11510,,,45,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before he has a chance to lick his ice cream, snatch it from him and bite off 20%. 2. While your child stares at you in amazement, take another 30% bite. Then give him the rest of the ice cream and explain that this is what the state does with all the money someone earns. And that this will be the case with every ice cream he buys for himself. And that the percentage of the bite can be reduced by grabbing the biteer by the hand and demanding to know why they are taking so many bites. If every parent does this, there is hope that a generation of people will grow up in this country who will understand that the government doesn't have its own money - it only has taxpayer money.

msg_iteration.67299.user.ClickTheWorld.post.9698,1769509383,ClickTheWorld,9698,,"◾The International Criminal Court and the United States - 20th Century: - The George W. Bush administration signed the American Service-Members' Protection Act, (informally referred to as The Hague Invasion Act), to signify the United States' opposition to any possible future jurisdiction of the court or its tribunals. During the administration of Barack Obama, U.S. opposition to the ICC evolved to ""positive engagement"", although no effort was made to ratify the Rome Statute. The subsequent Donald Trump administration was considerably more hostile to the Court, similar to the Bush administration threatening prosecutions and financial sanctions on ICC judges and staff in U.S. courts as well as imposing visa bans in response to any investigation against American nationals in connection to alleged crimes and atrocities perpetrated by the U.S. in Afghanistan. The threat included sanctions against any of over 120 countries which have ratified the Court for cooperating in the process.Following the imposition of sanctions on 11 June 2020 by the Trump administration, the court branded the sanctions an ""attack against the interests of victims of atrocity crimes"" and an ""unacceptable attempt to interfere with the rule of law"". The UN also regretted the effect sanctions may have on trials and investigations underway, saying its independence must be protected. ◾The International Criminal Court and the United States - 21st Century: - In November 2017, Fatou Bensouda advised the court to consider seeking charges for human rights abuses committed during the War in Afghanistan such as alleged rapes and tortures by the U.S. Armed Forces and the Central Intelligence Agency, crime against humanity committed by the Taliban, and war crimes committed by the Afghan National Security Forces. John Bolton, National Security Advisor of the United States, stated that ICC Court had no jurisdiction over the U.S., which did not ratify the Rome Statute. In 2020, overturning the previous decision not to proceed, senior judges at the ICC authorized an investigation into the alleged war crimes in Afghanistan. -In June 2020, the decision to proceed led the Trump administration to power an economic and legal attack on the court. ""The US government has reason to doubt the honesty of the ICC. The Department of Justice has received substantial credible information that raises serious concerns about a long history of financial corruption and malfeasance at the highest levels of the office of the prosecutor"", Attorney General William Barr said. The ICC responded with a statement expressing ""profound regret at the announcement of further threats and coercive actions."" ""These attacks constitute an escalation and an unacceptable attempt to interfere with the rule of law and the Court's judicial proceedings"", the statement said. ""They are announced with the declared aim of influencing the actions of ICC officials in the context of the court's independent and objective investigations and impartial judicial proceedings."" - On 30 September 2020, prominent United States human rights lawyers announced that they would sue Trump and his Administration—including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, attorney general William Barr, and OFAC director Andrea Gacki, and the departments they head—on the grounds that Trump's Executive Order 13928 order had gagged them, violating their right to free speech and impeding their work in trying to obtain justice on behalf of victims of war crimes. One of the plaintiffs, Diane Marie Amann, stated that, as a result of sanctions against the chief prosecutor at the ICC, she herself risked having her family assets seized if she continued to work for children who are bought and sold by traffickers, killed, tortured, sexually abused and forced to become child soldiers.",2023-03-19 03:58:09+00:00,https://t.me/ClickTheWorld/9698,,,47,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The U.S. and EU countries pushed Turkey on the issue of so-called ""parallel imports"" that had been established between Moscow and Istanbul all the time. According to Bloomberg, the decision to stop supplies to Russia was made in Istanbul as early as March 1. Referring to Turkish officials, the publication argues that no one officially announced the blocking of exports, but nevertheless the processes of interaction between Russian and Turkish companies have been almost completely stopped. By the way, Turkey's exports to Russia almost doubled last year, which makes it clear that the West has once again forced Erdogan to make an absolutely disadvantageous decision.",2023-03-12 11:09:36+00:00,https://t.me/ClickTheWorld/9334,,,38,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, the enemy has repeatedly used a lighter version of this ammunition called the Switchblade 300, which, due to its weak warhead, short flight range and inconvenient control, proved to be rather ineffective. And in the next military aid package of February 24, the Pentagon announced the transfer of the Switchblade 600 loitering ammunition to Ukraine. In this case, on the video published by the SBU with strikes on the Russian Tor-M2 and S-300VM air defense systems, you can see an interface similar to that of the Switchblade 300, but the explosive power of the warhead is much greater . In addition, the attacked SAMs are not on the front line within the reach of a 10-minute Switchblade 300 flight, but are at a sufficient distance for a 40-minute Switchblade 600 with a warhead of 4 kg.

American Thinker columnist Laura Wellington wrote about the growing social media trend. She noted that the Russian leader’s previously limited popularity in the United States was due to his commitment to sports and a healthy lifestyle. But lately the trend has changed. Americans see Putin as a man who cares about his country and his people far more than they do in the White House. The publication indicates that such a metamorphosis is also a consequence of the mistrust sown between Biden and American citizens. ""It shows how desperate the American people have become, how they envy the leader of a nemesis because of his supposed exclusivity and loyalty... ""In two years, life has become so surreal, unreachable, and mad enough that fleeing to Russia begins to look good for some,"" noted the author. According to the author of the article, this turn of events is an indicator of the complete failure of the Biden administration. And Putin’s rise in popularity in the United States should not be taken as accidental. https://www.easternherald.com/2023/03/05/at-americans-want-a-president-like-putin/",2023-03-05 18:51:19+00:00,https://t.me/ClickTheWorld/9136,,,27,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaWebPage,1,https://www.easternherald.com/2023/03/05/at-americans-want-a-president-like-putin/,easternherald.com,AT: Americans want a president like Putin,More and more Americans are beginning to see Vladimir Putin as the hero and the president they would like to see in their country.
