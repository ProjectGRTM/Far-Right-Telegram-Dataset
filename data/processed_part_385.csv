The system has made it nearly impossible for whites to have a traditional family. Women are incentivised to kill their babies in the womb and rampant no-fault divorce and it's consequences disincentive marriage for men. Why would you marry a woman knowing that she could divorce you at any moment, take half of your money and worst of all, your kids? Why would women save themselves for marriage or settle down when they're told that having children will weigh them down and staying home to raise children is akin to being a baby making slave? The system tells us that the world is overpopulated while complaining about the declining birth rates. All of this is by design. They tell whites to not get married and to not have kids and then when our birth rates drop below replacement level they bring in tens of millions of low IQ, non-white immigrants to replace us.

His name is Neale Rundgren AKA AethelwulfArt. His work largely takes inspiration from Scandinavian Folklore and Mythology (his own culture) though his work delves into German, British, Slavic, Iberian and other folkloric traditions and heritages as well. We have personally commissioned him for works ranging from Logos 📻, divinities 🎅 and even into graphic design for our previous publications 📖. Not least of which are the above images which were just our Commissions of the Last year for various long term works of our own. So if you would like to support his work and would like to get one of his works for yourself check out his Artstation. Or see about Commisioning him yourself if he can fit you into his busy schedule. jolly Yule and a Merry Krismas Folks from Hyperborean Radio (Ike & Jeff) 🍄Hyperborean Radio (Uncensored)🌲",2024-12-07 22:13:49+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/6096,,,275,0,2,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2024-12-07 21:09:16,2024-12-07,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/12354,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alright (looks carefully at notes) 40% Combined No, Missouri is Clearly part of the South/Missouri is Part of the Ozarks a Smaller yet Proud Region! (21%/19%) While in the end the votes cast No, the fact that it was all so close really epitomizes how odd American Cultures, Politics and States can be. Missouri has always been the odd one. In the Midwest the Great Plains states of the Dakotas, Nebraska and Kansas have always been more akin to being Great Plains and merely adjacent to the Midwest. Accepted as part of the ""Inland Empire"" as it is sometimes affectionately called but all vastly different from the Great Lake States and the two primarily Mississippian states of Iowa & Missouri. While there is rarely contention over Iowa being midwestern even though much of its western half is part of the Great Plains to some extent, the same cannot be said for Missouri where Ozark culture, Southern accents and it's status as a border state in the Civil War have given it a unique feel in comparison to the other Midwestern states that border it. On top of all this Missouri has a complex mixture of history from the Missouri Rhineland in its central riverlands and vineyards to various famous cowboys who found their way there. The state is a mixture of beautiful forests, farm fields and riverlands. Though Missouri is also arguably the most indicative of the ""Redneck Riviera"" those cultures that persist along the Mississippi and who hold great stock and pride in themselves, for good reason. As someone from the Midwest (Iowa) who has lived in two other states, I will say Missouri always felt like the odd one out. You felt like you were in a completely different country going there, though the same couldn't be said of Illinois or Wisconsin. Which felt more like a regional shift in the Midwest at least outside of Chicago or the Superior Separatist Movement regions. Overall No State truly fits its macro-group. But whether Missouri is more Dixie or Ozark, Redneck Riviera or Middle America I suppose comes down to personal interpretation. To me it will always seem more a part of Dixie than the Midwest, a definitively Ozark state. An Island of their own. I suppose time will tell if this is just the unique state that Missouri is or if one of those cultural trends will win out on the National stage. But for now Missouri is definitely Missouri.",2024-12-04 18:18:55+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/6084,,,435,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,video/mp4,5.080149053568714e+18,1.94,Missouri.gif.mp4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a way of looking at and experiencing the world with you and your kind as the focal point. The Axis around which all else revolves. The core difference between this and Christendom is that Paganism is well aware that nothing else shares this Human-Centric View. The Sparrows are Sparrow-Centric, the Wolves are Wolf-Centric. Humans are not the most important thing in all of existence Human's are the most important thing to Humans. Paganism is not the veneration of Zeus or Odin, it is the veneration and exaltation of a People. If said people are not centric to the general worldview but prostrate before a deity.

msg_iteration.155.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.5947,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,5947,,"Arguing that Our Ethnic Gods are Owned by Marvel has always been a fallacious argument. 1. The Pagan Gods far predate them, and the Marvel versions aren't even very similar to the actual lore. 2. Most of the Gods are still not used or barely touched even some rather ""big ones"" like Holda, Lugh, Ilmarinen, Freya. 3. By the same logic that they present with Marvel owning the European Gods one could argue Hollywood owns the Abrahamic God by a far wider margin. (The Passion of the Christ, Ben Hur, Left Behind, The Exorcist, Bruce Almighty to name a few). 4. Such an argument then asserts that the Ethnic Gods are commodities to be owned while the Abrahamic God has free reign to produce as much propaganda or modern retellings to proselytize their religion. Especially as many Catholic films are actively pushed by the Vatican. Double standards from the Foreign Faith are nothing new but should not be tolerated. 5. Film, Video Games, Books and Comics; especially in the modern day, are an incredibly valid way in which to enrich people by exposing them and reminding them of the beauty of their Ethnic beliefs and traditions. Doing so does not give ownership to the creators but duty. 6. One thing to always remember however is the responsibility on those that know the lore, regardless of their actual religious affiliation, to protect our ancestral ethnic traditions and beliefs. As well as to point out both the good and bad of adaptation. (IE:GOW Thor vs. GOW Angrboda). 📌 Hyperborean Radio (On The Road) 🗺",2024-10-21 17:13:02+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/5947,,,518,0,8,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2024-10-16 16:44:44,2024-10-16,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/12267,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To the Church doctrine this was proof of our Demonic heritage a mark of the hairy colorful devils they concocted to vilify our Gods and Ancestors, our blood to them was tainted, we were devilspawn.

By our very being we are the enemy of Abrahamism and so they seek to destroy us. Our cultures, our history and our bloodlines. Their religion was merely meant to be a leash, a means to keep us in check as they bled us like cattle, to brainwash us against our own. But we mighty few see the Foreign Faith for what it is. And we know we would rather dine with our ancestors in Hell than with their God in his horrific realm. For we may be Devils to them, but to our own Kind we are the Kin of the Gods themselves.

Different regions were settled by different cultures and while on the surface America is uniform. Beyond a glancing look it gets more and more distinct. Many kept a tribal Ethnicism, the core difference was that Churches functioned as cultural hubs. Because they were mainly used as local halls. So you would do 98% Ethnicism and maybe 2% Semitic faith? It varied but super Christian areas tended not to last long in isolation without changing. And the other kind didn't have much use for the church and often hung the priests for being crooked (nothing new we just have the internet).

Though Media and Government propaganda has stifled much of it, it still flourishes though mainly in ways one may find themselves overlooking. These differences may be stark at times but we are still American. We have a lot of work to do to protect, preserve and Repair our land and people from the damage that has been done to it. But we have never shied away from a challenge, a fight or a drunken bar bet. I have faith we can do it. In fact I know we can. Thank You for Participating in these polls. May the Gods Bless America. May the Son's and Daughter's of Columbia Stand strong on her Gem of the Ocean, May we Usonians Flourish on this beautiful land. - (Usonian=A Beautiful if oft forgotten epithet for Americans, Usonia=United States of Northern Independent America.)",2024-10-05 06:01:59+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/5865,,,673,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,video/mp4,4.902662407689602e+18,2.331,Flag Gif.gif.mp4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Months ago I would have likely picked the option that they were the same. But since traveling across the country I have come to no longer think so. While our beginning as a tribe or species may be in Europe and thus could be considered a homeland on a foundational biological level. I no longer think in such clear cut terms. Americans are a unique breed, whether a Texas German or a New England Irishman. The people who have this land in their blood are easy enough to notice. There is a mindset even in the most ethnic of houses that proliferates with our kind here. The Pennsylvania Dutch, The Cajuns, The Amish, Tarheel, Hoosier, Hawkeye, Yooper, Badger and Texan. Each variety has a distinct flavor. Different regions, states, counties and ancestries will produce a slight difference. But the way I could put it in as American terms as possible is that one may be Rocky Road and another Moose Tracks but its all Ice Cream. This compounded by the fact sometimes whole towns or regions would be emptied out of Europe. Irish Clans that are no longer in Ireland, The Hesse who are no longer in Hesse. America may not be our cradle but it shall be our descendants, for us this is still a Spiritual Frontier, a homestead somewhere between the Wise River Rat, Hardened Mountain Man and Magical Hobo. Having a Bison for a neighbor and a Bear to play Euchre with. Simultaneously too Feral and too American for Europe to deal with on mass. We both hold traditions the other forgot, but we also built some new ones. I will hold the Continental Germanic Lands of my forefathers in my heart, but I will also admit that most recent things from Germanic lands just make me scratch my head. For many others it may not be the same. But for me for better or worse this is home. I'm a bit too feral for Germany and the Alps anyway. 😂",2024-10-05 05:53:23+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/5864,,,550,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,video/mp4,4.902662407689602e+18,9.701,Iwo Jima.gif.mp4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though the pattern of many of the most popular answers reveals the true concern people hold. What is an American and Who Can Be American? This has resulted because of the conflict that has resulted in American society and culture today. Where the virtues and philosophy we have extolled and had drilled into us, as twisted from its original meaning as it may be. Where we wish to be the country that can hold the light of liberty above us and accept the Huddled Masses Yearning to Breathe Free. But we have also been paying so harshly for it for decades with callous leaders orchestrating our deaths and importing their mercenaries and destabilizing savages. All in the name of some false American Ideal. To them I say there is only one punishment for Treason. I alone cannot answer the question as to what an American is. I can only speak from the Heart and from experience. Americans are an interesting breed, the shadow of Europe, everything they did not wish to be, both the good and the bad of such a people. Up until WW2 as we settled much of the continental 48 we paid for it in blood, sweat and tears. We swore oaths to the ideals of the USA and we brought our own culture as well as grew with America. We carved out a place for ourselves forming micronations or in some instances such as the Cajuns or Missouri Rhineland whole countries not entirely contingent on the borders of the official state. Even recent Europeans who have immigrated to America have not ""Become American"" White Brazillians, English, Germans and Russians are still who they were. The difference is not time... but cost. Americans can be recognized because we paid the blood debt to be here, we were given refuge by the land. Not Economic Handouts and a Cushy Desk Job. We are the ones who made American Exceptionalism a Reality. We are the Mountain Men, The River Rat, The Traveler, Tycoon and the Riverboatmen. We are Legion, a people of madlads in wonderous variety. Whole tribes emptied out of Europe and came here to find refuge. We made friends with the Bear and rode the stag and bison, we herded Elk and spoke to the Salmon, we climbed Cyprus and Redwood. Conquered Grassy Seas and endless Mountains. America's Rivers are in our blood, her fruits and game are in our flesh. We are who we are. The followers of the God and Ways of America, Columbia Mother of the people and our land. Devoted to in statues and paintings, in carved eagles and hung Buffalo Skulls. We are not just Americans, or Celtic/Germanic/Etc. We are Usonians. United by history and sacrifice. We carry the will of our Forefathers with us. And no Paper-Americans and Traitors are going to take that from us. The People are what matter, the ideals change, the government changes.

It was about the feel of Halloween, while I was young I didn't quite understand it, we've all heard the ""Halloween was Invented by the Candy Companies"" line at some point, but that is a lie.

Nowadays there are around 250K descendants of these Confederate Expats. In Southern Brazil the land is not too dissimilar to their homeland of Dixie and it was there they founded the City of Americana. To this day various celebrations and continuations of their Southern American cultural heritage are proudly practiced.

Heathen=Of the Land/Heath, was a term used to mock the people that were still part of the land and kept the old ways of the Wood, Stream, Mound and Blood. These are not Religions, they are older, more profound and powerful. A means by which the roots reach the stem and The Old Ways are New Again in every wide eyed babe.

Many died on the frontier, in the pestilent and polluted cities. Others were brought over as indentured servants and many died in the harsh labor jobs of mining, manufacturing, fishing among other jobs where the health of man was outweighed by the health of the dollar. Those that survived these trials and ordeals of course wanted the best for their children, their heirs to their sweat and blood. What they conquered and built shedding the blood of the fallen across every inch of this land. They did not do all this so we could hand it over and paint them as villains because someone who doesn't give a shit about us said we were being mean.

She is directly tied into many holy days such as Grundsaudag and Allelieweziel and many folktales, many of her and the other gods stories are tied to the American land and incorporate many German and American customs including Steins, Hex Signs, Distlefinks, and more. As Holle is the leader and divine patron of this German-American tribe, her sickle is the symbol they wear in contrast to the Mjolnir typically worn by modern Norse & Germanic Heathens.",2024-08-23 16:01:23+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/5660,,,551,0,14,1,PeerChannel,1518985858.0,AnAmericanSpirit,2022-04-21 16:22:08,2022-04-21,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/1167,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whose experiences exploring the mostly unexplored Western USA along the Green and Colorado Rivers would radically change him, inspiring him of the necessity of what came to be called ""Watershed Democracy"" yet what is that and who is this bearded bestial looking man anyway? Born in Mount Morris, New York in the Spring of 1834 Powell went on to fight in the Civil War where he lost most of his right arm from a Minié ball at the Battle of Shiloh, forever leaving him with but a stump where his arm used to be. Not long after he would lead several expeditions to chart the West, though they were perilous, one he undertook with ten men and several rowboats down the Green and Colorado Rivers. Only to come out in the end with 6 half naked men and a few pounds of moldy flour between them. He'd become an American Hero but was forever changed by his experiences. After his expeditions, he advocated that America must carefully settle the West as unlike the bounty of the Mississippi and Great Lakes that the East has, most of the West was a Desert. Using a combination of Mountains, Forests and Rivers of the Land he and his team charted the Western Watersheds and advocated State and Country Boundaries to be based around these natural land marks to avoid conflict and the destruction of the Land. However between his stubborn, wild and passionate demeanor and the fact he was going against the Narrative of the Time of the endless bounties of the West and of Gods divine intent for America his ideas were rejected and most senators of the time ended up detesting Powell and his ideas. Yet one wonders what may have happened had his idea been heeded, how different the map would be? Would the Dust Bowl Never happen? Would the Colorado River still charge forth into Mexico? No one can deny, his prediction of the conflict wrought by the scarce water of the West was all too prophetic.",2024-08-22 14:57:35+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/5656,,,524,0,12,1,PeerChannel,1518985858.0,AnAmericanSpirit,2023-06-25 00:10:02,2023-06-25,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/3666,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tart, intensely fruity, high in Vitamin C berries are used to make some of the best jellies, and are often added to other berries such as blueberries, blackberries and raspberries to kick up the sweetness and flavor.

A Barn Quilt is rather simple in idea but immensely varied in design. As the Barn Quilt can be any pattern or shape but is most often painted with Quilt patterns and designs. Such as Corn and Beans, Jacob’s ladder, Compass Star and Carpenter’s Wheel, among many others. Many are based off patterns that have been passed down in family lines making the Barn Quilts a form of familial Heraldry. Other Barn Quilts will use regional, local or even historic patterns to paint their Barn Quilts. Many of the Barn Quilts are painted in honor of historic moments and even in memory of a loved one. Despite the iconic Folk Paintings they are today, the oldest Barn Quilts are thought to be pictures sewn into Quilts and Hung on the Side as a way to communicate who lived there or even occupation. They have since exploded in popularity since the turn of the millennia and become a popular tourist attraction with several Barn Quilt Trails popping up. (Some people who will not be named because I don't agree with disparaging the differently abled think they invented it in 2000) Do You Know of Any Barn Quilts? Do You Have Any Family or Local Patterns You'd Like to Make Into a Barn Quilt?",2024-08-18 13:01:49+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/5629,,,482,0,20,1,PeerChannel,1518985858.0,AnAmericanSpirit,2023-03-12 21:35:37,2023-03-12,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/3163,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If one does a quick glance around the interwebs they will see claims it originated as a Christian Song specifically in Ameriblack Circles. Or that it started life as ""When the Chariot Comes"" that it was a reference to The Underground Railroad and later used for Mother Jones a Labor Activist... This is all complete and utter Sh*t. The Song is actually about what else, a prostitute. It was sung by workmen specifically miners and the like who would often look forward to the arrival of or traveling to ""Entertainers"" specifically of the female variety. Though in the modern day this may seem crude the reality is it was not uncommon outside of the heavily Puritanical areas of the United States Prostitutes' were common and might even have status. Folklore is replete with them such as the magical Brothels of Paul Bunyan Lore or the beloved Mate of Doc Holliday Big Nose Kate or even Pecos Bill's true love Slue Foot Sue. Like most of these elements of American Folklore repeated attempts have been made to clean up the Song rebranding it, changing history in order to fit the false idea of a heavily Christian and prudish nation (Prudish Nations Don't Make Cowboys). The Song despite being considered a Children's Folk Song is more of a Workmen's song expressing their excitement for the prostitutes and the lyrics are all thinly veiled references to the acts and joys the men would associate with these women. The Six White Horses are the Men Lining up to be ""Ridden"" while many of the other lyrics change too often and have been altered deliberately to reveal the songs original meaning.

No this battle is much more shades of Green than black and white. The battle between the freedom to be as we may and that of a controlling overarching doctrine. One could call it the war of the Pagan vs the Puritan. Though it is more complicated than that.

English, German, Spanish, Irish, Italian, French, Swedish, Finnish, Polish and many others both within and without those tribes. America may be where we tie our saddle and sup our meals but THE CRADLE OF OUR KIND... there is no denying that is in Europe. You must simply take back your... OUR homelands.

Therefore there is no American Nation by the True Meaning of the Word. This may seem odd but I often find American Nationalism rather cringe. To be clear there are many many issues and the forced diversity, DEI and rampant immigration both legal and illegal are issues this country has but ""Nationalism"" in America is a confusing topic. Irish, Germans, Italians, Slavs that came over here weren't exactly welcome. There have been constant failed attempts to homogenize American Culture and on top of that by allowing all the Not-Us into the country in droves we gave up our ancestral claim to the land by right of conquest and now simply live here. A Hoosier is not a Tar Heel is not a Cajun is not a Yankee. There are many subgroups in America that up until now had at least some reason to have a shared identity or purpose but that is no longer the case. The reason ""American Identity"" is something that seems so quickly to become generic and downright saccharine is because trying to figure out how people from Rural West Virginia and the Mormons of Salt Lake City are the Same People is a fools errand. They aren't. We know they aren't. They are ""American"" in the same way Europeans are ""European"" the core difference being they don't even have the genetic lineage to claim that most groups in America are ""Immigrants"" or more accurately ""Conquerors"" since many groups that came here during our history actively aided in some fashion of the conquest of the American Empire. Now what America has is a free for all. We are defined as a whole by Geography and nothing more. The land of Cascadia and the Land of New England do not even have enough shared history to bother calling them the same country besides legalities. If we wish to defend this land, to reconquer it and claim it as ours than the first thing we need to do is acknowledge these sub-groups because ""American"" is generic, but the smaller Sub-Groups of loosely confederated tribes are what made us strong and what make up what we call America. If you have to whittle the entire country down to Flags, Beer, Guns and Pick Up Trucks. Or some Melting Pot Nation of Immigrants BS than we've already lost. There are rich ""Cultures"" here, PLURAL. But pretending what the founding documents say is somehow the reality is like claiming anything written into Law is reality and not wishful thinking. ""One Nation Under God"" was Wishful thinking. American's are not a Nation nor under One God, we are a Confederation for better or worse.

No quite to the contrary, Irish were not accepted with open eager and waiting arms, in fact they were shipped out of Ireland, driven out, kidnapped and sold, some ran for their lives (mine after most of our clan was slaughtered in the night), and many many more who stayed died. Accepted you say? No I don't think so. Moved, suffered, worked hard, overcame, rose up, created their own businesses (because no one would hire them), bought land, raised families despite hardships, joined the military, fought and died in the wars of their new homes, started fire departments, and worked hard to inspire pride in being Irish and Ireland herself.

If you've ever seen the original designs for Superheroes especially those like Superman you have had the urge to or made the joke about him wearing his underwear on the outside. While this is a head scratcher in the modern day it actually makes total sense when the comics first appeared. As the strongmen acts of the time that populated boardwalks and carnivals often featured scantily clad Adonis' with nothing but boots and a pair of ""Trunks"" or as we would call them today ""Speedos"" the incorporation of this imagery into the costumes of Superheroes was meant to show their massive strength and power.

After many claims concerning ""But I'm -???- and I can't find any information."" Let us begin with the obvious for America. The Bear: As America was settled we returned to our wild natures and with it came to recognize once more our Forest Cousin. We again learned and lived alongside the most beloved of animals The Bear, The Face of Gods. Columbia: American War Goddess and Alma Mater. She who nourishes the ideals of Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. She who joins us when we are led astray. So beloved songs were sung to her, giant idols carved, people once even called America Columbia. Paul Bunyan: Born of trees and mountains, his axe crafted by dwarves and whose mighty crew molded the nations landscape reminding man how to live with nature. When his lessons were scorned Paul took his leave to the North Pole where he and babe now create the Northern Lights. Kris Kringle: Santa Claus, the God of Christmas, Children, Hope and Winter Storms, The King of the North and Beloved Dead who gives gifts to the noblest of children and punishes the worst. Embodying the Spirit of Giving and Communal bonds. Joe Magarac: The Spirit of American Steel and God of crafting, Industrious and Hard Work, Born of Storms and Mountain Ore. He so loved his people that he melted his metal flesh into the steel itself so that they may work and flourish. Lady Luck: The most fickle of Gods, credited with the Revolutionary Victory that created America, today her shrine can be found, it is known as Las Vegas. Where the Lucky and Unlucky alike court her favor.

Now there are many tales told of how Paul came by his signature ax, the most common is that he made it himself pulling a whole towering pine tree up out of the ground to form the handle, yet perhaps my favorite has much more of that mythic nature to it that exists in many American myths but is so often buried by what sells at roadside attractions or Kids films. That he was given it by the spirits of the earth. Now see just like the Ax Paul himself has many origins from flocks of storks, to arriving washed up by the sea to being born of old trees and becoming a sort of forest god, but this one seems to follow the vein of Paul's origins that has him akin to Joe Magarac in that he was born of the mountains themselves. Molten ore flows through Paul's veins as much as steel forms the flesh of Joe. Born of the Earth it stands to reason he would pal around with spirits of the earth. Sometimes its dwarves, others gnomes, and some others are more generic in their earth spirits. But this story holds that Paul received his Ax as a gift from the Spirits of the Earth (Dwarves) and it was because he chose to leave his mountain home and go amongst man to show them how to live with nature. This was Paul's noble goal and his gift to his camp followers. It also shows why when people put profits before nature he fled North away from those who broke his heart. Either way Paul's Ax is an iconic image and is even a Trophy between two rival football teams.",2024-07-22 10:59:29+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/5487,,,636,0,6,1,PeerChannel,1518985858.0,AnAmericanSpirit,2022-09-14 15:27:08,2022-09-14,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/1923,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, aside from the usual legends of flying over cars and scaring a passerby the Mothman is also connected to the deaths of 46 people as he was spotted and connected to the Silver Bridge Collapse in 1967. After this the Mothman became more associated with being an omen of destruction or misfortune, perhaps a spirit who feasts on fear?!

Well turns out they do! The results are hilarious and amazing! Popular themes include 50's Diners, Cowboys, Steakhouse, Texan, BBQ, Burgers, Midwest or Sports Bar. Though Amerindian, Surfer and well known city dishes also happen. Japan has several including Bronco BIlly's serving famous American dishes like “I stewed the Bronco hamburger and beef muscle meat of collagen plentiful.” & who can forget traditional American Bacon boiled and served in the water it was boiled in just like Mom's. There is Indiana Café in Paris which serves Traditional Hoosier Cuisine or Tex-Mex, order classic items like Nachos Indiana if you're feeling homesick. There are also chains such as Ireland's Eddie Rocket's which serves 50's Diner fare though if you want extra cheese you'll need to use the American phrase of ""Pimped-Up"" to let them know. Quite possibly one of the most beloved institutions and birthday party destination is Spur Steak Ranch with an Amerindian theme whose menu includes varieties of traditional American Schnitzel with Mushroom Soup atop it, Spur is beloved across South Africa. There's Old Wild West in Italy a bizarro Olive Garden. Moscow has Beverly Hills Diner complete with a Pulp fiction dance performed by staff to really make you feel American beside statues of Elvis and Betty Boop. As much as I may seem to be mocking these restaurants I actually love them! Americans don't tend to realize how unique our food is and often downplay it. In these restaurants abroad I am reminded of how interesting our culture can be via outside eyes. From Memphis Diner in Paris to the Yellow Rose of Texas in Peru if you're ever nearby and in need of a steak, burger, brownie, malt, pizza, chili or any other American Dish stop in.

But there was once an older Bristlecone Pine known as Prometheus who was around 4,900 Years Old. Then Graduate Student Donald R. Currey was researching the Little Ice Age and with the Forestry Service gained permission to core the trees however... while stories vary and there is vast controversy surrounding it Currey's Increment borer broke and he received permission to fell the tree to access its rings. It was only then that they realized they had cut down one of if not the oldest tree in the Western Hemisphere. You can still find sections or pieces of Prometheus across various places including Nevada, Arizona and California.",2024-07-18 17:43:40+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/5467,,,645,0,8,1,PeerChannel,1518985858.0,AnAmericanSpirit,2023-06-16 14:28:06,2023-06-16,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/3630,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They received it in the form of some simultaneously fascinating and hilarious depictions of the Founding Fathers including George Washington Punching a Tiger, fighting Asura (A Dharmic God) and being presided over by the goddess of America (Columbia). While Ben Franklin is depicted as a stoic warrior capable of holding and firing a cannon with his bare hands. While John Addams is a super human warrior whose mother is eaten by a snake, Addams than seeks out a Mountain Fairy and with the aid of the Fairy's giant Eagle defeats the giant Snake and avenges his mother.

It got me thinking once more about why I am so repulsed by Universalism and why I am far more drawn to our own ways. The traditions, Gods, ancestors and ghosts of our people. Colloquially known as ""Paganism"". In Universalism there is the adamant belief that there is one creator at the head of all things, in Paganism this is generally absent at least in the older stories. There is no ""Correct"" Pagan God. To claim so is a fundamental misunderstanding of Paganism. Each God is their own entity and tied to their own people, to venerate a God outside of your own Kin is to venerate the people, their people. Universalists, Christians for most of the West are adamant that they have the one and only divinity and are willing to attack or even kill over it, despite often not even knowing, or personally rewriting like the one above, who their God is. I will not venerate a God who wants my people Dead, and by extension his people who are enemies of my own. The Lore of My People was writ long ago, in the blood within our veins.

All Others are Devils. They are intelligent enough to realize that most Christians are Hypocrites and Have No Idea who or what their deity or religion really is. They do not think there is another option because they are taught paganism is Devil Worship and the only option most of them see is Viking Larping or the Made Up New Age Faiths of the Last Century and a half. Islam has the same God and even includes Jesus as a prophet not a God, they are required to know their religion on punishment of Death. Though they are likely unaware of that particular clause upon conversion. Islam presents itself as stable, masculine, powerful and focused on tradition. Is it any wonder the Youth end up converting when we give them such information and options?

I more or less figured that Denver and Omaha would end up being towards the top for name recognition, though Kansas city also makes sense for various reasons. The only city that got minimal votes was Calgary and that was due to being Canadian which inevitably cost it some points. Personally in an alternate universe or potential future Bismarck makes the most amount of sense. Not for what it currently is but for what it could be in such a geopolitical environment. Its' placement near the Missouri River and its centralized location within, especially with the addition of the Canadian Prairie Provinces incorporated as the Northernmost territories of the Region and New Found Nation of Plainsmen across the Great Grassy Sea. Such things are fun to think about and also give a good glimpse into regionalism in the USA, absent the rest of the Country as more or less guaranteed resources what changes about life and how people would live? Would the ideas of John Wesley Powell causes Watershed States or Counties within the region? Would Mound and Sod Houses Make a Comeback? What would agriculture, trade and culture look like in such a shifted state of self-sufficiency drawing from it's pioneer and cowboy roots? the reliance on rivers and abundance of game from the Northern Mississippi to the foothills of the rockies?

In reality I wasn't wrong, but that is not a bad thing. Or at least I no longer consider it to be. After all... American DNA doesn't show up on a Test. Some may point to the Injuns, but the Injuns are not a singular group anymore than the ""European-Americans"" are. They are not ""Americans"" that is the name the Europeans brought and embraced upon themselves. They are Cherokee, Crow, Sioux, Ojibwa, Haida etc. Not and never American. With Americans it is much the same and the argument for who counts has never gone away. The German Problem and The Irish Problem are still talked about today and many of us are considered animals in private by our more WASPy Countrymen. Even those that Identify primarily with their American heritage either due to experience or loss of memory are not American First they are Appalachian, Cajun, New Englanders, Californian. Not ""American"", especially with the newfound reveal of the term ""Undocumented Americans"" being American has lost all meaning in our country. While I'm not about to spit on the flag and cheer the tearing down of our monuments I am going to admit one basic truth. Without the overarching American structure the ""American"" in the Hyphen-Americans is not what sticks around it is the Irish, German, Acadian, Basque or Italian that stays. Because the reality is mankind is tribal and America for better or worse is nothing more in practice than an idea. The American Spirit is only strong so long as we nurture it, but it is near dead and so currently is our country. Perhaps we shall make it through but even some of the most American Cultures such as the PA Dutch often choose repatriation to their ancestral homes over staying where they made a new one. You cannot change the blood or alter the nature that ages forged in us. We did not lose our Germanic or Gaelic Nature because we learnt English and started watching ESPN. We are who we are. The Hyphen Stays, everyone else realized that their ingroup preference makes them strong, we forgot, we drank the Kool-Aid but we will remember. - Image: An Immigrant Family Arriving on Ellis Island",2024-06-28 17:28:18+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/5384,,,601,0,10,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.713.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.5379,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,5379,,"7 Myths About America That Non-American's May Believe 1. America is an incredibly Right Wing Country Years Ago I saw a graph of European Politics vs. American Politics and it argued America was incredibly right wing with Trump (A Business Democrat who is left of center) being off the chart he was so far right, while Bernie Sanders a Socialist was placed as a moderate centrist. America is the exact opposite, our country was born from the liberal policies of the Enlightenment Period and we are for better or worse a fairly liberal country. But naturally we are far more ""Libertarian"" or Liberty Driven than simply ""Liberal"" as the modern term has come to mean. In modern US politics and for my whole lifetime there has not been an actual Conservative American Party in the USA, the Republicans tend to just be whatever the Progressive Party was 30 years prior. 2. American's have So much Space America is an enormous country larger than some Continents, but part of this is Alaska which is nearly a third of the country's landmass and is mostly owned by the State, Injun Reservations or Rich Landholders. Most of the Population is along the coast and East of the Mississippi, the West is mostly Federal Land with several states almost all Federal Land, Along with several Injun reservations that are larger than most countries including the Navajo, or taking up most of Oklahoma (which is really only a state for legal reasons). Put simply most ""Free"" areas are off limits to most and we're mostly penned in. 3. Americans are all Mutts Whether ""Mutt"" means 50% Polish-50% French or Aztec-Spanish the answer is no. Americans actually mostly settled with like ethnicities and until the 1900s many areas actually spoke the Old Tongue. German, French or even Gaelic. With Gaelic Speakers in the USA outnumbering those in the Isles and even having been used to help reinvigorate the Gaelic Tongue. Only recently have people began dating outside their group in any number, many areas are basically Micro-States that are (Now) Americanized recreations of their ancestral homeland. 4. American's are Rich. As I have mentioned before we have an entire large country worth of people below the poverty line or invisible altogether. Many of us are barely able to afford food and lodgings, with entire swaths of the population putting off marriage and children due to poverty. While on Paper we may look rich, the American Dollar doesn't go as far in America. We have many Billionaires but all that does is skew the average. Even those who keep their heads above water are one bad day away from financial ruin. 5. America Has a Gun Problem. America's Gun Problem is that we don't all have guns. The worst areas for gun crime are the areas with the tightest gun laws. If the 5 most violent cities in the USA were removed from the country we would become one of the safest countries on the planet, in the top 10 in fact. Many Mass Shootings have been stopped before they got started due to Gun Owners including the Draw Mohammed Shooting and an Iranian Tranny attempting to shoot up an Alphabet (Google) Office. Both stopped by gun Owners. 6. America is Heavily Christian. The highest percentage of regular Church Goers the USA has ever had was Approx. 40%, when the country was founded it was around 11%. Before that we were a country who followed a lot of the old ways, we had hero cults, pioneer demigods, local spirits, not to mention all the Priests we hung for trying to force us into Church. 7. American's are Intolerant. Americans are incredibly tolerant that is part of why we are in such a crappy situation. The most taboo position in the entire country is to be considered some sort of bigot. However this has been weaponized AGAINST Americans and to shutter honest discussion and debate. While many still cling to the old Tolerant Ideals of the last 80 years, there are only so many Child Porn and White Guilt Books that can be found in grade schools before the dam breaks. Our first Motto was ""Mind Your Business"". What happens when you make YOUR business, OUR BUSINESS?",2024-06-27 20:56:58+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/5379,,,1830,0,27,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I do not disagree with this. Both held nationalistic views more in-line with their ancestral country then the one they were born or lived in, both had tight knit communities that often behaved and preserved ways more akin to their old country, both were often shipped in by elites as a form of labor, Germans as Skilled Laborers vs. Mexicans as Manual Laborers, both actively voted to benefit their own group over the good of the nation as a whole. However... There are two massive differences that make it less of an apt parallel. 1. Germans are culturally similar to the other founding stocks of America and were ourselves ""Founding Stock"", so while assimilation doesn't exist, we can get pretty darn close. You're Welcome for Santa, Blue Jeans, Hot Dogs and the Easter Bunny. 2. Many areas of America were settled or ""Colonized"" BY GERMANS, in other words certain areas of America belong far more to the German immigrants who settled them and their descendants than any other later immigrant group to those areas.

msg_iteration.827.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.5265,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,5265,,"Many people in the past by modern standards would be ""Unemployed"". They would work three to six months sometimes a few years in a larger town or area and then go back home and use the money to enrich their community. Funding festivals, niceties and often bringing trades and skills that they had learnt in the larger more affluent areas. The Goal was Never to devote their life to a career or a job. Such things were a means to an end and were done only as long as they were needed. Thus on their ancestral land they were able to be part of their community, growing much of their own food, maintaining their own homes, spending time with family and resting. Most people in truth don't wish to be rich, they simply wish for the kind of freedom we had before we were supposedly released from daily drudgery. Many may decry such a lifestyle, as lazy, or mention we may lack certain modern amenities. To them I point and ask ""Which has more value? The miles of 'car graveyards', government contracts to generate goods which will be tossed into the trash one year after manufacture, or time? The time with family, the time with a clan well built, time with communities and the ties which bind. 🍄Hyperborean Radio (Uncensored)🌲",2024-06-11 00:49:44+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/5265,,,537,0,14,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2024-06-10 14:56:47,2024-06-10,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/11993,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Mind your own business"", ""Just let them"", ""Be nice"", ""Don't say anything"", ""Don't rock the boat"", ""They can if they want too"", ""Who's it hurting?"". All of these and more are why. One step at a time and the next thing you know hundreds of leagues have flown by in the blink of an eye. The truth is we represent our kind at every moment of every day, through every action and every inaction. Standards of behavior must be upheld at all costs, at all times. Ignobility is unacceptable. Strength, Courage, Wisdom. The traditional, native and most importantly inherent compass of our people which guide us to honor and nobility of action. These invisible forces become tangible in the world through us, through our actions, our attitudes, through our hands. What happened to the world we once knew? What happened to accountability? Quite simply we started being nice. Be Kind.

You refer backward to the day of the buffalo or the day of the lion or the day the jeep busted her ankle... We headed out of camp while the dew was still bright on the grasses, looking for nothing. It is a gorgeous way to hunt, looking for nothing. You spin along in the jeep and just look. the breakfast is still warm inside you and the second cigarette is tasting almost as good as the first. The sun is just beginning to take a touch of chill off your face, and the woods and plain are alive, vibrant, with tentatively stirring animals. The birds, just woken, are beginning to scratch and fly around and complain. You drive along by the wood or the river or out along the veld and you almost hope you will see nothing worth working for that day because it is more fun to watch it than to chase it"". -Robert Ruark 🌲Hyperborean Radio (Uncensored)🍄",2024-06-04 17:16:23+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/5216,,,588,0,6,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2024-06-03 18:05:00,2024-06-03,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/11978,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability to cook is a fundamental skill required of adult humans to stay alive. Male or Female the expectation is that you are able to cook at least well enough to not die, should you be stripped of PF Changs, Frozen Pizza and Delivery Apps. Many women may ask men if they can build a house? The answer is a resounding... maybe. We've been building model houses, forts and camping structures since we were kids. It is engrained in the very DNA of the Male to have some building abilities that we naturally pursue in our own play. But these are not equivalents as mentioned before. If a man is to know carpentry, Advanced Algebra, Blueprint Creation, Masonry, Plumbing, Basic Electrical Wiring, Large Equipment Operation, Team Management, Budgeting, Painting, Landscaping and several other trades. It is only fair to ask a woman for her equivalent. Can you manage a home? Handle and build a household budget and familial wealth? Store, Prepare and create a viable food stock for harsh months and lean times? Can you handle the ability to create an environment of peace and rest, or at times readiness should war arrive on your doorstep? How well can you temper your emotions, and weave alliances and protections so that the home is safe and watched out for by community and kin? How are your skills at mending? Decorating? Healing? How closed are your lips and how open are your ears? Could we as men trust you with managing the house we build and defend? Could even our wage slaving job build wealth under your capable hands? Could a modest budget make a home built for kings and queens under your skills? Could you monitor the health of your family and guard against the existential threats of rumors and liespinning? In essence could you do one of the most important things on the very planet, requiring skills cultivated for years. Building a true home and thus!

Many large trees start off at a disadvantage, and some trees seem to do best when they start off as a tiny sapling on top of a fallen log. As these saplings grow with more access to sunlight, the strongest outcompete the weakest and eventually the roots will reach the soil, resulting in a line of trees with exposed roots. In this example, a line of growing Sitka spruce trees flourish on what once was a huge fallen log, but is now decomposed by time and decay.

These juicy, sweet member of the blueberry family are found from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean (with a few isolated locations eastward) and have been enjoyed by wildlife and humans for millennia. This official state fruit of Idaho is a particularly important food source for grizzly and black bears, and traditionally the Native Americans have been eating them in dozens of different ways: fresh, dried, smoked, crushed up in soups or mixed with salmon roe - to name a few. These huckleberries were photographed (then eaten) just below the tree line at the edge of a subalpine meadow in the North Cascades National Park, near the Canadian border in Washington State.

This love is to be found in your Sons. While it is true a Son might grow to dislike his Mother; love and like being two different things. But you can rest assured he will ALWAYS love his Mommy, without reservation. There is not a Son among the Hyperborean people; child or grown, that would not move the world to save his Mommy or even raise every last inch of it shaking the very roots of the Earth itself in vengeance of her. He will love her completely and truly for the entirety of his life from his first wail to his last gasp, even after she is gone. So raise your sons well! Be gentle with him. Guard his heart so that he might not become cruel, but remember; You are raising a Man. A child brought into this world through countless ages of great hardship and even greater joys, by you! Born and bred of love, a love whose sole purpose is to defend his people with the same vigor he would defend you. To safeguard the vulnerable but not the weak, to teach the lessons he has learned throughout his life so that those under his protection might thrive. So teach him well. Teach him the respect he is due and the responsibilities he must bear. Teach him of sacrifice and love. Teach him his value so that he might not settle, nor demand more than is his due. Teach him both his own value and the value of others. Teach him to think for himself. To question. To understand and see the world around him. Teach him a little rebellion is good for the soul of a Man and to be expected. But also teach him where to draw the line. To give respect but to demand it in return! Remember he's not the shield, nor is he the spear. He is the man who wields these tools! Not the tool to be wielded... Remember it's only through you he will learn what a woman SHOULD be, so be noble. Remember he will one day demand your example of womanhood in a wife of his own. A Woman who will in turn give you Grandchildren who will also honor their Grandmother; or not, in the same way he himself had been taught by you. Become honored. Raise your sons well. Raise them with the dignity and pride only a Mother can have in her Sons! Happy Mothers Day. We Will Always Love You Your Sons The Hyperborean Men of the World.

That would be ""Thunderstruck,"" the opening track on The Razors Edge. In addition to ""Thunderstruck,"" the band brought out ""Moneytalks,"" probably the closest they ever came to writing a pop song. Then there was ""Are You Ready"" - one of their fiercest calls to action. The gritty edge and booming chants on this album were a welcome reminder for a new generation that pure, unadulterated rock 'n' roll was alive and well. Lyrics: [Intro] Thunder, ah Thunder, ah Thunder, ah Thunder, ah Thunder, ah Thunder, ah Thunder, ah Thunder, ah Thunder, ah Thunder, ah [Verse 1] I was caught In the middle of a railroad track (Thunder) I looked 'round And I knew there was no turning back (Thunder) My mind raced And I thought, what could I do?

In many cases they have already succeeded, innumerable in Albion alone. Yet... there are those in which their machinations have shown but yet to come to pass. Such as The Ravens in the Tower of London and The Rollright Stones, both ancient charms of protection. The Ravens are a gift from the God-King Bran the Blessed. Who was slain in battle and whose severed head was buried facing out so that he could always watch over Albion. The proof of this are his ravens. Once nesting in a Sacred Grove but as the city grew over it they came into the Tower of London. It is said that so long as the ravens remain in the tower Albion shall never fall. The last time they all left the British Empire Collapsed. The 'Mayor' of London has made it clear he wishes to be rid of them... I wonder why? The Rollright Stones; an ancient stone circle approximately 4000 years old on the border of Oxfordshire & Warwickshire, are said to be the petrified remains of Knights of King Arthurs Court frozen by Merlin until Albions' Hour of Greatest Need. They have attempted to put a Road right through them... Like all stories there are many variations on the Ravens and Rollright Stones. All OF Our Lore. This is not the first time such attacks have happened even upon Albions' Shores. Centuries ago they drove out The Bear and The Wolf from the Isles as well as destroying beloved treasures. Now they do the same defacing our remaining ""Idols"" or eliminating the likes of both The Badger and The Hedgehog, beloved in Albions' animism and history. Our enemies know our Lore and what it means to us, this is War to them. It is we who seem to have forgotten.

To the point there are entire genres online of people living a life that would once have gotten you called ""Vagrant"" or ""Hick"" but because they've rebranded it to ""Off Grid"" or ""Vanlife"" it is now cool. Increasingly the dream is not to move to the big city, it's to escape it, but the small towns once populated by working class people whose ancestors had settled the town centuries past are now vacation homes, hunting cabins and the dominion of the upper class. Those that don't succumb to this fate succumb to urban sprawl or become one of the many ghosts towns that dot the countryside. As land prices skyrocket, and land taxes weigh people down generational homes are a thing of the past, you cannot build your own home even though such homes are often some of the most longstanding domiciles, people can no longer grow their own food in their own yards because they will catch a fine, increasingly the average joe can barely afford a cup of joe, but is expected to work to just survive and be thankful they escaped the horrors of the past, of an intact family living in the rural land growing much of their own food, sewing their own clothes and being self sufficient because they had to be, of having neighbors you knew and trusted, of having rivers to swim in and woods to hunt in! Such a life has become something only the wealthy can afford. While the average working class can barely afford a studio apartment. I do not write this to bag on the wealthy or chastise those who are able to live this kind of life, I merely write it to ask why? Why is the lifestyle the poor were once mocked for now out of their reach, while those with means glory in being able to experience it themselves? What are the consequences and conclusion of this course of action? And perhaps Why, if this is such an undesirable lifestyle did it become something that the rich possess and the poor lament? 🏔Hyperborean Radio (Uncensored)🌲",2024-04-05 16:45:24+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/4940,,,583,0,18,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2024-04-05 16:42:31,2024-04-05,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/11801,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.1151.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.4937,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,4937,,"Invincible Season 2 Review: A Disappointing Soap Opera of a Sequel The first season of Invincible was the best of a series of ""Evil Superman"" shows and films that came out around the same time. The sophomore season however was disappointing. No plot point was truly finished, one (as in the viewer) is left hanging by the end as characters go through trials and tribulations and deal with the fallout from the first seasons revelations. This is all well and good but drags on far too long - by which I mean the entire season. While I don't mind character development and more plot than just 4 episodes of Super Saiyan power ups this season felt like nothing happened. We are still ostensibly at the same place we were at the end of last season. It feels the entire time like the characters are running in place and getting nowhere fast. While there are a few quippy jokes that land, some meta humor that doesn't, the show is at it's core not a comedy but an action story. Invincible is an homage not a satire or parody. I have not read the comics so perhaps this was a faithful adaptation, perhaps not, but it introduces several characters without really giving them anything to do in regards to the main story. Each episode feels as if its building to something that never materializes, but most notably the entire show comes off as some sort of out of time series, with the second season premiering 2 years after the first and concluding 3 years after the first aired. The people who enjoyed the first season are in a different point in their life and Invincible seems as if it is trapped in the past. The world has changed so much in so short a time that the show becomes this odd bizarro depiction of both American Life and the World presented within. While I prefer escapist shows to not be dragged down by current events I couldn't help but watch the show as it seemed to pretend it was something it's not as if I was watching an aging millennial desperate to maintain some sort of cultural identity relevant in his early 20's well into his 30's. Stuck in a world and situation that doesn't reflect the current one it is trying to comment on. This would be all well and good if the show did not attempt such commentary at all, but in doing so it attempts to root itself in the world we live in now, or at least a version of it. As the show continues to walk in place and attempt to project or continue these character arcs. One question arises as to why we should care, the genre it spawns from is falling from cultural consciousness faster than the musical did, the characters seem stuck in the same roles they were in years ago while those outside of it are struggling or overcoming various things. The show in essence has lost anything that once made it special and instead has become a Soap Opera of Sorts, with characters that seem less and less relatable and more and more hollow. I will not be watching Season 3, on pure quality I would probably have given this season 2 maybe 3 stars if I was feeling generous. But I'll never get the 8 hours I spent watching this show back, the best I can do is hope that I can help others escape suffering the same fate. Invincible may be invincible but he is definitely not enjoyable, in fact if I had to rename the show and character it would simply be ""Skippable"". ⭐️1 Star/out of 5",2024-04-05 03:41:38+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/4937,,,702,0,1,0,,,,,,,1,4936.0,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/4936,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meat is tasting worse and worse, the flavor is increasingly nonexistent, certain cuts from the store whether it be breasts, bacon or chops are leaving me feeling hungry-full and causing headaches and muscle aches like my body is trying to reject it.

That's just the whole foods, more processed foods like flour or juice have lost much of the taste they once had and leave you feeling malnourished. That's before getting into things in the ""Legally Food"" Category, but I digress. I'm glad to know I wasn't just being paranoid...

Then wearing dark goggles and bracing themselves for the heat wave and raging winds people would gleefully watch the spectacle of the worlds largest bomb being dropped. Las Vegas even became known as ""Atomic City"" in their promotions of the cities Atomic Tourism. The Mushroom cloud became a popular symbol being made into fashion, candies, Toys, Showgirls Costumes, postcards, headdresses and even Miss Atomic Beauty Contests.

Disney has never been some beacon of Moral Righteousness, but I honestly can't think of a single massive company that is. Almost any of these responses could've been valid, which is why Multiple Choice wasn't a Choice. I wanted to see where people stood with the Mouse House and found that most people took the middle ground. Admitting Disney is a flawed and even depraved company, but has also been a leader in animation and at least during Walt's Tenure a place of magic and dreams. Even if there were still the omnipresent issues beneath the surface. Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy and Pluto, Mary Poppins, Snow White and a seemingly endless repertoire of classics once beloved across the world. Now... Much like anything the positives that once existed have fallen away. Walt and his tenure are long gone, regardless of one's opinion of him. Successive Rulers were less visionary, more profit focused. Not that such things were unheard of before between the treatment of actors for Snow White and Peter Pan or the Misleading of the Influential Carl Barks, even attempts to copyright our ancestral cultures; Disney has never been spotless, but now that is all one can see. Disney is no longer the Magic Kingdom, it is the Mordor and Isengard upon the Shores of Florida and California. Consuming Dreams rather than spinning them in dwarven magic and elven craft into films that inspire. Now between the soulless remakes and sequels, attempts to copyright Our Gods, the attack on schools and even desecrating the graves of children. Disney has destroyed it's own legacy. But it's influence upon the world and especially the Medium of Animation can not be denied. Time will tell if that's enough to leave them as more than a footnote in history. Because the Future for Disney... is never a guarantee.

msg_iteration.1260.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.4825,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,4825,,"When Americans Lived in Tree Stumps The “Ancient sequoias,” “Mammoths,” or “Big Trees” as John Muir called them -also redwoods- are the giant trees that once ruled over the West Coast. As a sort of primeval land this final frontier of the contiguous United States was a fabled realm for both Americans further East and for settlers coming from Europe to start a new life. Alongside the Gold Rush the most important industry in the area was the logging industry. Given the Fairy Tale and Mythic quality of the size of the trees it was natural that not only would it take months and months to cut them but that they would leave a rather impressive stump. Not ones to let things go to waste the Settlers took to the stumps turning them into hotels, dancefloors, Post Offices, barns and yes! Even Houses! With some being as small as a studio apartment while others were three stories tall! These fantastical Stump Houses are effectively the traditional houses of the Western Coastal States and they existed up into the 1990's as Roadside attractions and Local Landmarks such as the famous stump house in Eureka, California. Sadly many if not all have since rotted away. Though one can imagine the sight of neighborhoods built in the middle of the Forest with dance floors atop amber sealed stumps and homes fit for a Keebler Elf or Forest Faerie.",2024-03-10 15:33:33+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/4825,,,7385,0,142,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's most notable trait is the odd Yellow Color chosen for the protagonists which are meant to be Middle Americans of European Descent. The Color was chosen for the innocuous reason of it being eye catching as people flipped through the channels. However! There is more to this choice than may first appear, knowingly or not they may have gotten closer to showing what we look like and it may be seen most blatantly in a throwaway joke from ""22 Short Films About Springfield"", the Same episode that gave the world the Steamed Hams Meme. When Lisa gets Gum in her blond hair she goes to the barber to get it out, first he cuts the hair away to remove the gum, revealing pale whitish skin beneath, implying that Lisa is covered head to toe in a Blond Pelt of Hair. While at first to us we may laugh at the ludicrous nature of this joke, it is actually closer to the truth than many may think. You see Hyperboreans, Occidentals, Caucasians, or more Commonly Called Whites or more narrowly ""Europeans"" are covered in a light undercoat of blond hair we affectionately call ""Peach Fuzz"" but is actually called Vellus Hair while invisible to us barring a ray of sunshine or lamplight, we notice when it isn't there and the other races simply do not have it. Chimera's may have it such as Ameriblacks having an odd patchy growth here or there, for us it coats us like a fine velvet causing a Halo effect, making us much softer to the touch. As well as being a means of staying warm and dry. To the other races however our Golden Coat is very easy to see, with some even calling us ""The Hairy People"" (Northern China) Or ""Giant Pink Hairy Monsters"" (Africans). Companies thrive off making us self conscious of our undercoat resulting in expensive and damaging procedures to have it removed, maiming our women and men alike! Take Pride in your Golden Glow.

msg_iteration.1306.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.4779,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,4779,,"Tribe & Facial Hair One of the most significant and distinguishing features of the Hyperborean Male is our voluminous beards ""Our Manes"". Not all of our beards are the same, any man who grows one is quick to notice the differences and eccentricities of each one, ""my beard is not the same as your beard"". Part of this is age, health and care but a lot of it comes down to tribe. Every Hyperborean tribe has a slightly different style of facial hair that grows naturally, to the point that one of the giveaways as to which ancestral group you belong to, whether it be Gaelic, Alpine, Scandinavian or Greek, is how the beard grows. One need not have one that can be tucked into one's belt but long and wild enough that its quirks and shape are more defined is more than enough to indicate ones ancestral roots. Each Tribal Group will differ within but broader trends are there, the flowy beards of the Gauls, the wavy and wooly beards of the Alps, the wild seemingly sentient beards of the Gaels, the curly beards of the Greeks. This is even present in the shape of the mustache as certain Spanish tribes Mustachios will grow with the trademark Spanish point, while the Gaulish Mustache will drape proudly from the upper lip, For the Alpine German's their mustache will fan out too thick and full to drape and rather jut out to the sides like a wild tree branches. The act of shaving one's beard for our Tribes is one of emasculation to remove an indication of heritage, of tribe. While it can make it a bit easier to ignore different groups in proximity to one another, as was commanded by Alexander the Great to make his men a bit less aware of their tribal loyalties. It is also a punishment historically to force a man to shave his mark of manhood. Notably the Church would punish the Pagan ""Werewolves"" with shaving, doing so for the reason by their own words ""That when they died their ancestors would not recognize them"". Deny the Defilement. Embrace Who We are. Let Your Manes Flow. 🏔Hyperborean Radio (Uncensored) 🌲",2024-03-02 15:47:32+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/4779,,,572,0,16,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2024-02-27 17:52:10,2024-02-27,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/11683,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While most of these are innocuous there are those which truly meant something... once. Now they are a vestigial marking with none of the spirit or meaning they once did, a trick of a Faerie Riddle Meant to evoke nostalgia and pride, while our enemies are paid to make half-arsed products. I speak of Labels Such as ""Made in America"" Versus ""American Made"". Labels that evoke the strong rough men and women who built the American Country, in whose tales Heroes and Giants reigned over wood and foundry. An image that once populated Norman Rockwell and War Bond Posters. Or Across the Pond to Merrie Olde England where images spring into mind of the hard working Englishman with stiff upper lip, a scion of crafts reaching back to The Age of Myth. A strong determination and a vast arcadian countryside populated with freefolk who make merry and craft objects unrivaled! But while these are the images meant to be called to mind as if by some spell, they are anything but true. Nowadays American Factories are a cacophony of foreign languages and illegal aliens. The Americans are shunted or forced to hold up the exhausting weight of their counterparts. And in England no one thinks a proud Aston Martin was made by a Punjab or An Arab... and yet this is the reality we face. These hand built objects are no longer built by Americans or Englishman but simply mostly, kinda, if you squint really hard, in their borders. Let not their spell be cast. Hand Built in England no longer means built by English Hands. 🏔Hyperborean Radio (Uncensored)🌲",2024-03-01 21:06:54+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/4773,,,546,0,12,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2024-02-29 17:40:29,2024-02-29,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/11693,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They have been both Our Cousin and Mother to Empires. After Millenia of fear mongering the Wolf has been crafted to a devil that plagues the god fearing. Much of our kind view the Wolf as a fiend. A perfect excuse to slaughter our faithful Lieutenants of the Wood. In the US & EU Wolves have been receiving bad press, blamed for numerous livestock deaths. But this is a falsehood, wolves may be anything but harmless but they are also not mindless killers or depraved manhunters. In the US this has led to mass culling of Wolves in the Western USA. In the EU various ""Wolf Attacks"" have sparked outrage & fear, notably the death of Ursula Von Der Leyen's Pony. Sheep, Goats, Cattle and Horses have all been the victims of Wolves. Yet wolves have a method to their hunt and feedings. The deaths quoted in articles describe horrific corpses torn asunder, guts strewn for miles, 10's of thousands of slain livestock. This is not how Wolves work, nor can so few wolves kill so many as Wolf packs are comparable to the Families of Man in size and functions. Wolves hunt to eat and then gorge themselves until they are full, they may not eat for weeks. Waste not, want not. Dear Ursula's Pony was elderly, livestock die all the time, falling over, gas build up, corpses explode and scavengers delight in such events. Tearing bits off and carrying them away by wing and by claw. Not to mention Domestic Dogs that gleefully kill whole flocks for the sheer thrill. Nor can 11,000+PY French Livestock deaths be credited to their mere 130 Packs (2 Kills PW) a tall ask if they weren't hunting wildlife as well. Some even describe a kind of mystical curse left after wolf attacks, sheep breeding in freefall and new lambs running into roads and walls! So, is it the wolves? Or is it something else? 🏔Hyperborean Radio (Uncensored) 🌲",2024-02-29 17:15:09+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/4769,,,617,0,11,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2024-02-22 18:03:09,2024-02-22,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/11670,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,video/mp4,5.098393387447353e+18,52.018,Wolves Feeding on Elk Carcass from Brushbuck Wildlife Tours.mp4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was doubtful that the Midwest where I was born and live now could truly be home, or indeed anywhere on the North American continent. But this is a symptom of the times. But... yes this is my home, or at least where I hope to build it. When my ancestors came over the course of hundreds of years across this land settling the East Coast and as far West as Nebraska and the Far West they may have been homesick whether they came for opportunities here or lack thereof back home, if they were forced by court or by blade, they came here and made sacrifices generation after generation, many of which never knowing I or any of my fellows would come to be, we were an idea one that may never have crossed their minds. Then instead of thinking of what was missing, the thousands of years of history or the mountains my ancestors in the long ago lived in, I instead looked to how lucky I was. This continent, this land is unbelievably beautiful. Mountains that dwarf the likes of much of the world, freshwater seas you can sail like a Boreal Odysseus, and riches in ways that we cannot fathom. Trees fit for giants and seas of grass that seem to drown everything else but the storm and bleached bones. Animals that seem to ooze the age of the land. The gift of our ancestors may not have been the land we held for millennia but it was one they conquered and built for us, their bones are beneath our feet their ghosts were given to our monuments. I understand why many would wish to return, this place seems less and less like home the more we've let it slip. But I myself cannot throw away what our ancestors made for us. Rivers of blood, Oceans of sweat and host upon host of dead built this place for us, left it in its grandeur. I plan to stay and continue their calling. Who knows what the future brings, but I know I stand on a truly hard won foundation. This Land is My Land. This Land is Your Land.

msg_iteration.1371.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.4714,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,4714,,"William Holbrook Beard (1824 - 1900) What is satire but a preceding idea, forged from imagination? William was a prime example of a painter who threw out all expectations, to paint what most would have deemed peculiar, albeit appealing. He was an American painter, renowned for his whimsical or satirical depictions of animals, oftentimes bears, performing human-like activities. There doesn't appear to be any boundaries which control his subject matter, ensuring it remains tame or refined. It's clear he forged ahead, creating an engrossing world in which people would easily be transfixed to William's different approach to art. What fascinates me the most about his paintings are the pagan elements - almost straight out of an old European fairytale. Dancing bears? Frolicking Squirrels? Cackling witches upon their broomsticks? Much of which gave him vogue because who can really resist happy animals doing human things? Whether or not William drew inspiration from European folklore, the folklore is evident. It's almost as if he tried to create his own idea of the land of the Fae, but with a slight twist, applying it as an experiment to see how the subject matter interacts with the world of humans. The painting he did of Santa Claus is my personal favourite, and possibly one of the best paintings I've seen of Santa Claus, because that is exactly how I would imagine him coming to town, breaking through the veil of our world, bringing cheer and joy. William is easily in the top ten of my favourite artists because his paintings are a reminder of the rich tapestry of folklore we have, best to keep us in high-spirits in an increasingly dark and chaotic world. Escape to the world of dancing bears and animated forests for when you need a break from the muck of everyday life.

It's a city I have yet to visit and have never really known much about, though I have heard it has ""Gone Vegas"" whatever that means. But it seems to have far outpaced the likes of New York and Philly. Though Boston was a close second and Chicongo and New Orleans filling up third place rather nicely.

Between 1856 and 1876, he delivered mail between Placerville, California, and Genoa, Nevada. Despite his nickname, Thompson did not use snowshoes but rather the method of cross country skiing from his homeland. The delivery trips usually took around 3 days. He carried no blanket and no weapons and claimed to have never lost his way in a blizzard. His preferred route was known as ""Johnson's Cutoff,""which today is known as U.S. Route 55 from Placerville, California to South Lake Tahoe.

msg_iteration.1420.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.4665,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,4665,,"Happy Groundhog Day! Groundhog Day is one of my favorite Holidays. Its tongue-in-cheek nature, its simple and community focused elements all centered around a certain famous Seer, one Groundhog. Not Punxsutawney Phil though he is the most famous of ""his"" seers. The Groundhog himself is a bit different and hard to quantify. You see The Groundhog is a being that is both a delicious dinner and a delightful divinity. In the folklore The Groundhog is often attributed magnificent seer abilities, considered the one true weather prophet and to have been born in Chaos itself, recommended by Mother Earth as the one to search out for true prophecies. Much like other animal spirits and Gods however, The Groundhog exists in the Groundhogs themselves, less in a specific incarnation and more within all of them. The Groundhog exists in a unique cross section of animals, over the years he has been attributed both the old Lore of the Bear Cult of the Germans and the Gaels as well as that of smaller burrowing animals such as rabbits and marmots. Similar to these burrowing animals they carry messages across the realms, traversing in their complex burrows from realm to realm. In the Long Ago it was a bear that was the focal point of the Holiday, but as the Church moved across the land spending a millennia long crusade against its greatest competition wiping most of the bears out and spreading propaganda to paint the Forest Cousin as a fool and an oaf. By the time the Pennsylvania Dutch's Forebears arrived they and other Germans had already traded for Hedgehogs, Badgers and other burrowing animals for the Holiday that eventually became known as Groundhog Day. So the current heir to the Throne of Weather Seer and the focal point of the hope of Spring and Joys of Winter became The Groundhog. The ""Bear Rodent"" who was also I hear absolutely delicious.

I guess a 50/50 or 40/40/20 split isn't truly definitive. However knowing someone that likes them and actually liking them I suppose are two different things. There is also the fact so many people never listen to lyrics or actually know anything about their ""Favorite"" songs or artists and often just go along with what they perceive others as liking, hence ""Popular"". But considering such a drastic split and the fact that apparently some of these large pop sensations have actually paid people to buy tickets to their shows, much akin to Disney with Captain Marvel and other films. One does begin to suspect they are manufactured even if people supposedly like them. In the past Pop Culture was Opera, Classic Literature, Mozart and Paganini. Nowadays we have assembly line production on all fronts, and the lack of heart and soul to match.

It shows a barren landscape with a touch of stillness as the colours transition seamlessly from a coffee brown to an ""underpaint"" of red mixed with white to paint the mountains. His use of colour creates a warm tone that fades as the sky darkens, making it rather inviting to the observer. Imagine standing upon the rocks overlooking the deep gorge for a glimpse of an ancient deity enduring his punishment? The imagination should run wild with excitement.

We tell ourselves it is for the best, they tell themselves it is for our good. The story is that it is for their health and longevity, but is it? The horrible truth, the most horrible of truths is the burden. We do not wish to take on the burden nor do they wish to be a burden real or perceived to the welfare of the young. The burden of illness, the burden of mind and temperament, the burden of time and cost. And so they go to the Nursing home or the Elderly Care facilities to be forgot. Like a dog abandoned at the pound to be cared for by those without care. It is true some employees in these places do, but let us be honest... most do not. They are in turn treated as though they are without value or as naughty children to be scolded, forgotten objects, a burden upon society. Do not forget these are our Mothers, our Fathers. Our Grand Fathers and Grand Mothers. Our Aunts and our Uncles. They are KIN! To abandon them no matter the sympathetic stories and rationalizations we tell brings nothing but shame upon ourselves and our ancestors. We teach the young that this is to be expected. We teach them that when a person begins to fail and falter, that they are to be left behind, forgotten and abandoned. Our elders raised us and taught us, they loved us and while we owe them nothing, we owe them everything. Lessons are to be taught whether they were good or bad in their own youth. Care and respect for those who were worthy of such honor, time spent in the winnowing days of dusk. Those moments during the last vestiges of their days which we can never get back. Were they cruel, they might be punished by our very kindness and joy spent with family. A joy they refused themselves and those around them as the light fades from their eyes. So care for our elders, learn and teach what you may. Our children are watching and remember one day... we too shall fade. 🌲Hyperborean Radio (Uncensored) 🏔",2024-01-19 16:24:30+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/4602,,,625,0,11,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2024-01-19 16:21:41,2024-01-19,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/11594,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The painting is of Romantic style, albeit dark and dusky, possibly to demonstrate the effects of luminism, which is to show how light is applied in a rather dramatic effect in contrast to the grandiosity of the landscape. It's clear Bierstadt desired to show the mountain in all its glory. Although the painting is a bit faded, it appears he included a pack of coyotes at the bottom. It's more-than-likely Bierstadt exaggerated the mountain to accentuate its majesty - something he was known to do - according to a few of his critics.",2024-01-12 17:31:42+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/4575,,,682,0,6,1,PeerChannel,1453731599.0,AethelwulfArt,2024-01-12 17:31:08,2024-01-12,https://t.me/AethelwulfArt/1001,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tasting a little more like a cranberry than some of the other darker huckleberry varieties, the red huckleberry is sweet with a very pleasing tartness, and is a valuable food source for deer, mountain beavers, mountain goats, and elk - especially in wintertime where many of the late berries persist after the first snow.

The real question was whether it was for the better or worse of the country and the world. Which the resounding answer was... No. With well over half the vote, only 4 people voted for it being an improvement. But why? California has or at least had a lot going for it. As a Midwesterner I'm far from the type of person to go to bat for the actions of Californians but let's take a more nuanced approach if we can. California, along with Louisiana, Texas, Florida, Alaska and Hawaii, is one of those states that is culturally distinct enough to be it's own entity, recognizably so. And unlike most states California did something that made it what it is today. It remained it's own entity not like Texas remained a Republic but in the way that Californians are for California first, something that much of the country lost after the Civil War. California built up it's own culture with imported East Coast Elites, Gold Miners, Spanish Missionaries etc, and utilized a complex economy and ecosystem. It's name, if Legend is to be believed takes its name from a Fictional Black Pagan Amazonian Queen whose people rode Griffins and fought beside Muslims... explains a lot really... But California also gave us the Beach Boys, Hollywood, Silicon Valley and to this day has some of the most iconic landmarks and species on the entire continent. California's greatest strength is also its downfall, its cultural and financial influence is such that it forced its beliefs and ideals on the rest of the country. It colonized nearby states and sold a dream which spiraled many bright eyed youngsters into crippling poverty on the streets of the Angels or Saint Francis. The issue at hand of California's influence is no more or less nefarious than that of Rome, Paris or London throughout the ages. But we can choose to say no, even if others say otherwise.

Distantly related to apples, they taste like an beautiful mix of blueberry, salal, crabapple and Oregon grape. You can eat them fresh (my favorite!), dehydrate them like raisins, make them into jelly, jam or wine, or bake them into pancakes, pies and pastries. These perfectly ripe beauties were found growing in Montana's Glacier National Park in midsummer.

It is used for a variety of uses in many countries across the globe: it can be eaten fresh as a salad or cooked in soups and stews, a refreshing tea or as a olive-green dye. Medicinally, it is used for the treatment of wounds, ulcers, sores and is known to have antibacterial properties.

But as the inevitable approaches there is a light. As individuals may fall, their light stolen from our embrace, others awaken. One for a thousand, then a thousand thousand. The warriors awaken from their slumber. We know the greatest enemy does not come from without as we can see them coming, it comes from within. Some looking like us with harsh words against our character, both friend and kin alike... sometimes from within our own beating breasts. Fear, uncertainty, trepidation. But we awaken, both from within and without, our numbers growing. Abraham is being revealed for the charlatan he is, the poison in our minds, the anchor on our soul. As quickly as the lies can be told they are being countered. People are waking to the danger all around them previously unseen, unrecognized. But now... NOW! The mist begins to part. The mist which has clouded our hearts and our minds. Political parties and ideas revealed as manipulative monsters designed for nothing more than control over us... our people. The guardians revealed as little more than zoo keepers whose only job it is to pacify us. The empty promises. The accusations projecting their own foulness upon us! No! All is not without hope. The fire only begins to burn and soon it will be a raging inferno as we unite burning away all of the liars and their world of lies as they stand exposed before the horrible truth!

""It's just another god"" they said ""let them believe what they want, it isn't hurting anything."" And they shoved Abraham down our throats. ""They are Gods people"" they said ""Let them live among us."" And they enslaved us by introducing debt. ""They are sinners"" they said ""We must set things right in Gods name."" And they set us upon ourselves. ""Why worry about the past?"" they said ""We were nothing before this."" And we forgot who we are. ""Just be nice"" they said ""Why can't we help them as the Lord commands?"" And we invited others into our homes. ""Don't be silly"" they said ""It's not all of them"" And they showed themselves to be monsters. ""Science says all mankind is one and you are inbred"" they said ""It's better to breed with others of foreign lands"" And we began to lose ourselves. ""Why can't you just be nice"" they said ""They know not what they do."" And they claimed everything as their own. ""Turn the other cheek"" they said ""it is better to take the high road."" And they kill our children. ""But we need to be understanding"" they said ""It's their culture."" And we lose our own. We are done. But who are they? The most insidious nature of it all is 'they' are not of other tribes. No! These voices came from within our own ranks for millennia. Was it members of other tribes that coerced you into being ""nice"" for so long? No, we don't listen to them until our own push and wheedle and whine and yell and threaten until we just go along. But I will now say ""They know not what they do."", so why should we listen to them? We must make a stand or die.

These are the words inscribed on the headstone of Sally Carter. Sally died in 1837, falling ill while visiting her sister at their family mansion, known as Cedarhurst. She was buried in the family cemetery on the grounds upon which the estate stood in Huntsville. The legend of Sally's ghost began in 1919. The estate had been turned into a hotel. A young boy was lodging there with his family. One morning he revealed to his family that he Sally Carter had appeared to him in a dream. She told him that her headstone had been toppled over during the previous night's storm, and would he please go to her grave and set it upright again. The boy's family played along, believing this revelation to be merely that of childhood whimsy, but they decided it best to humor him. Sure enough, when they arrived at the grave of Sally Carter, her headstone lay flat on the ground. Ever since that day, people have claimed to see Sally's spirit wandering the grounds or even inside the mansion. Some say she watches over children as they sleep. These stores brought an overwhelming amount of attention to the estate and Sally's grave, eventually resulting in multiple vandalizations of her resting place. In 1982, the grave was exumed and she was reburied in an undisclosed location on the property.",2023-12-26 23:57:20+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/4496,,,643,0,6,1,PeerChannel,1708539788.0,storytellingtradition,2023-12-13 21:20:38,2023-12-13,https://t.me/storytellingtradition/739,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't know how true this is for other tribes but for the Irish it is very true indeed and I hope this helps during these most troubling times. It happened long ago and the memory is a little fuzzy so I hope you understand I have to paraphrase some of it. I was a boy, about eight year of age and a great confusion came over me, like a static overwhelming every sense I had. After several days one of my Uncles knelt beside me as I struggled with the most simple of tasks and taking me gently but firmly by the shoulders bid me look into his eyes. ""Boy, I have something to tell you. Something one so young as yourself should not be burdened to know, but it seems you must. What you are experiencing is normal. It is due to an ancient pact that was made between our family and an ancient one. We pledged ourselves to Eire, her, her land, this is our home. To defend her, love her, her inhabitants, her men who also made this pledge, her animals and her soil, her shores and her waters, the birds and the insects. To every creature that runs or swims or flies within her home, our home. There is a call, it is strong and ancient this bond forever calling. The drive to stand, to bury our naked feet in her soil. To laugh and love and die in her embrace. We fight because we are warriors who pledged to defend her for all time because we were the mightiest of those who came. Eirin Go Brahg, it is more than a silly saying or some phrase to sling out without meaning. There are others who have always hated us, many who claim to be her children, but they work only to cut her, to remove her blessings and her bond from the true people of Eire. Those who were gifted and bonded body and soul to the land... You need to know this too. But there is a call, a pull and with that comes a longing, a sorrow, a great beating of the heart and a rage so deep it burns the very bones. A longing for a home you may never know. And for that I apologize. We were driven from our land long ago by these very usurpers. We fought, we killed our own kin to defend her. We killed to defend those who did not betray ambushed in the night, slaughtered in their sleep until a scream went up alerting the rest of us so that we might fight, and live. These were troubling times then and may you never know such times yourself but I fear you may and so you must know. The call is strong and will drive you mad should you let it. It will drive you mad with longing you cannot sooth, a sorrow you cannot know and a fury you cannot avenge. This is just beginning for you and will become more insistent in a few years when you begin into manhood. Eire is with you no matter the soil you stand on because will remain hers as she will remain yours for the rest of time. Perhaps one day we might be able to heed her call, because she is still under threat and always will be, but you must know that we to are under threat here. From here we will raise a great army and free her from her bonds! Blood will flow from friend and enemy alike! She will be free! All of our lands from here to there and back again! Be strong, be brave, and be wise. Take your time and remember. Do you hear me?! Never forget.""

Or perhaps catch a peek when he came down the chimney? Do you remember that innocent glee that filled you when you by chance saw someone who looked like him around Yuletide? Maybe even running up to them saying ""I've been REALLY good this year Santa!""? You may not have known it but this is one of the oldest of our traditions among The Hyperborean Peoples. The Gods look like us and thus those of us that bear a striking resemblance to the Gods BEAR A DUTY upon our shoulders. To embody them in everyday life and to do right by the sparkling eyed children who look at us with wonder. Others do so as their career or like the most devoted of Santa's in the USA they do both! Both embodying the God in looks and in personality. From the Red Bearded Chieftains -Thor- of Scandinavian Witch Cults, to the Fur bearing Matron God Richella of Italy, through the Alps with Perchten and Krampus to Alibon with Father Christmas amongst the Mummers, we have long embodied the God(s) in both appearance and in deed. Even taking our children to meet them as a rite of passage; as we do to this day, albeit with a more mercantile Santa Claus. Which is why many kids will avoid those but jump up and down in wonder and joy for Old Karl with the belly and big white beard who they meet at the grocer. Santa Claus in that moment is the most real thing in the world! More real than you or me, more important than the presents stuffed under the tree. Magic... The magic of belief. The child might even know it is Karl from the grocer but it doesn't matter as in that moment Karl IS Santa Claus. Every child knows Santa is wherever Santa is needed, appearing wherever that may be, looking through the eyes of others, but once in awhile... well maybe... just maybe, he comes in person.

In a complex industrial society, hero-making goes on at various levels, so that every walk of life and almost every occupation have their heroes. Thus, on the one hand, the schoolbooks and popular literature of edification draw upon the ranks of leaders—explorers, pioneers, soldiers, statesmen, inventors, and industrialists—for patron saints and tutelary geniuses, to inspire love of country or teach the ethics of success. On the other hand, the dime-novel concealed behind the geography book glorifies the gentlemen on horseback and the demons with the six-shooter.

Every Year in Breckenridge, Colorado a Celebration of Ullr, The Scandinavian God of Snow and Games is held known as Ullr Fest. The tradition stems from Norwegian Ski instructors at Breckenridge Ski Resort holding Ullr Dag Celebrations to honor their God Ullr and thank him for his gift of snow and teaching people to Ski. The celebration grew and Ullr Fest was created, involving Costumes, Winter Games, Snow Sculptures, Lots of Booze, A parade the Crowning of Ullr King and Queen and even a bonfire where old Ski's are burned. One could say that the Heart of the Cult of Ullr in North America is in this Colorado Town.

But apparently more than half of people are Marching Band Enjoyers, with twirling sticks, marching people, flamboyant costumes and a love of Brass instruments and waiting longer for football to start. Granted ""Marching Bands"" can be read a couple ways and a band that is marching is kind of vague, there also technically aren't limits to what instruments can be played so Bagpipes, Hurdy Gurdies, miles of trash cans being played by blue people can all count so long as they March to the heartbeat of Blood Drenched Mars.

Or as his original name reads Heikki Lunta? Old Hank has many titles and names in local Yooper lore such as Snow, Mr. Snow, King Snow, etc. He may have even descended from a Finnish Snow God from the Old Country, though which has long been lost to time. However Hank Snow has become one of the most well known figures of Yooper Myth and Legend even having the largest Yooper Winter Festival Heikinpäivä in Hancock, Michigan. Where you can find him blending in with the crowd looking as normal as any other Yooper Man with his bushy beard and snow goggles, wearing a warm thick flannel and a winter cap atop his head, though he may also appear as a pile of living fur coats. The Heikki festival involves the Three Heikki's: The Snow God Heikki himself, A Finnish ""Saint"" known as St. Henrik and a local Grand Marshall of the festival known as Hankookin Heikki. Those who don't believe say the Legend of Heikki Lunta grew after a supposed origin in 1970 when David Riutta a local DJ wrote the song ""Heikki Lunta’s Snow Dance"", this little song caused snow to fall across the land. The song proved too effective and necessitated another song created by Riutta to be written and played, the far less welcoming ""Heikki Lunta Go Away"". Riutta's first song gained fame for it's snow summoning properties even delivering snow to the Range Snowmobile Club's Snowmobile Race when snow had failed to fall in time for the big event. Like many Gods, Spirits and Legends of American Myth Heikki Lunta is no loner, he may be a God of Snow but he can be as snug around others as a warm fur coat, Old Hank is married to his childhood sweetheart Aino Mäkinen and their marriage has created a large extended family including his less than enthusiastic son Heikki Jr. @Hyperborean Radio (Uncensored)",2023-12-04 04:43:26+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/4383,,,523,0,7,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2023-12-04 00:43:34,2023-12-04,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/11460,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it is a staple food source for many birds and mammals such as deer, bears, and bighorn sheep, all parts of the plant and fruit are somewhat toxic to humans if eaten in quantity, although many native tribes used them medicinally.

msg_iteration.1750.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.4328,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,4328,,"Little Daily Heresies There has been talk of the endless conflict between Pagans and Christians. However I don't see that, I see a political institution desperately trying to beat back the natural inclination, culture and beliefs of our people. While the ""Pagans"", blissfully unaware carry on doing what they've always done. Most are Christian One Hour a Week and Pagan the rest. That doesn't seem poised to change. I don't speak of New Age Religions (Asatru, Druidry, Wicca) who masquerade as tradition. No, I speak of the beauty of the everyday little heresies performed innumerably by the supposedly Good Christian. The unintentional, the enjoyable and beloved. When they place the ancient symbol of abundance on the table at Thanksgiving, the Horn of Plenty. When they place idols to Harvest Gods known as Scarecrows in their yards. When they say the days of the week or months of the year in song or poem calling on Woden, Thor and Saturn; Janus, Mars and Juno. When the ancient Yule Tree is brought inside instead of being left out to light the night as it once was. When the ancient egg hunt for Easter of the Dawn is performed. When we place the symbol of Asclepius on our medical texts and take his dogs to see the sick and ailing. When we tell stories of Robin Hood (The Mad God), King Arthur (The Bear King), of Puck and the Fae. When we take children introducing them to one of our Gods, the King of Ghosts and Christmas Cheer himself, like the Witch Cults of Old and Kris Kringle asks the immortal question ""And Just who are you my dear child?"" Or when we tend to the graves of our beloved dead, or pray to statues we call Angels but know in truth are Genii or Fae. The list goes on and on, performed without thinking listening to instinct and the joy and sense of belonging within their heart. I need not worry or fret over the future of Paganism or the traditional beliefs of our people. We've already won. I merely sit back and smile at the soft beauty of Their Daily Little Heresies.

Such was the story of Joseph Palmer, an American farmer who grew a beard and was not only accused of being a heretic who emulated Satan with his mane, but was attacked with scissors in an attempt to remove his beard and then thrown in prison when the burly American proceeded to defend himself with a knife and stab some Christian Zealots in the leg. Serving a 15 month prison term for ""assault"" Palmer would eventually leave after his mother pleaded him to pay the fine, which he had refused as it would be akin to admitting he was at fault. He then joined the ill fated Utopian group the Fruitlands and after it fell apart bought the land and farmed it. By the time of his death beards had gone from hirsute heresy to the norm once more.

One of the smallest of garter snakes in the region, it is also one of the hardest to identify because of the extreme variability in color and pattern. One of the best clues without counting scale numbers and patterns is the head, which tends to be quite small for a garter snake. This one was quite large for this smaller species - it was over 30 inches when the typical northwestern garter is usually around 24 inches.

msg_iteration.1823.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.4255,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,4255,,"Cerro Castellan Cerro Castellan - also known as Castolon Peak or Castellan Peak, is a conical volcanic mountain in West Texas that rises 1000 feet above the desert floor (3,293 feet above sea level) in Big Bend National Park. Cerro Castellan itself is part of an ancient series of summits once known as the Corazones Peaks that has since succumbed to millennia of erosion by wind, precipitation, searing heat and bitterly cold winters. Geologically, this ancient mountain range remnant is a high stack of volcanic rocks, including ash, lava, and tuffaceous rocks. It is capped by a dense lava flow underlain by various tuffs and basalts. A somewhat northwest fault cuts the eastern face of Cerro Castellan. Although little vegetation grows on the sheer cliffs and steep, pointed profile of its peak, the lower slopes of Cerro Castellan support a sparse growth of Chihuahuan Desert scrub, including most prominently such characteristic species as creosote bush and ocotillo.

Out of the corner of your eye, in the chill of your blood or the thickness of the air. Perhaps you heard a door creak, a window shake, a voice from nowhere as the chair rocked ever so slightly. Have you ever been haunted by the souls of the dead... or the living? You see; Ghosts while ubiquitous and commonly known are oft limited to only a fraction of their true depth and power. A ghost not only a soul of our dead both beloved and reviled, but the spirits of the land and of the home, even The Gods themselves are Among the Greatest of Our Ghosts! But it is not only apparitions and Phantoms, deities and the Dead but also the living, the memory and afterimage, the impact of a spirit or idea that infects and lives its own kind of life, devoid of flesh and sinew but not fervor and spirit. As there are the little deaths to go beside the big one, the death of innocence, of love, of the life that could be. Haunted by what-ifs and maybes, of heartbreaks and summer fun. The most terrifying ghosts are perhaps those of our own making of both the greatest of losses and the grandest of joys! For who can truly say they have never been haunted by the path not taken, or the life lost to misdeed or mistake. Yet along with souls, Gods and memories lay the ghosts of ideas. Among the most powerful and sweeping, the ghost of philosophy, or fiction. The Ghost of Conan the Barbarian or Batman, Lilliputians or Huck Finn, of Religion and Politics. We are to a one haunted by ghosts of all kinds, for just as a rose is a flower, but a daisy is not a rose so too does the title of Ghost befit an endless procession of spirits and beliefs. Whether real or imagined it makes no difference, we are possessed and haunted by these phantom hosts for better or for worse. So...

Many died on the frontier, in the pestilent and polluted cities. Others were brought over as indentured servants and many died in the harsh labor jobs of mining, manufacturing, fishing among other jobs where the health of man was outweighed by the health of the dollar. Those that survived these trials and ordeals of course wanted the best for their children, their heirs to their sweat and blood. What they conquered and built shedding the blood of the fallen across every inch of this land. They did not do all this so we could hand it over and paint them as villains because someone who doesn't give a shit about us said we were being mean.

The hours are in general a left over from the time period when only one spouse would work in the marriage (at least full time not counting small things like selling baked goods, lace or extra eggs, etc.) allowing the one who stayed at home to go out and do the chores. But with both working many business have hours that have only an hour or two on both ends that many can even go to. I myself don't even work 9-5 but the hours still don't make sense. What's more is that many places are still closed Sunday, one of the few days people actually are able to go out and do things when they aren't working because of Church. So we have a schedule for work and businesses that are built around two things we no longer have in abundance, Zealous Christian Populations and Families where only one parent works.

msg_iteration.1972.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.4104,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,4104,,"Ancestor Veneration Begins with The Living Recently someone close to us weathered the death of a treasured family member, in the aftermath he discovered something his treasured Mother wrote of her Father -His Grandfather- a short recollection of a man who was her ""Freckled Atlas"" who raised her well with warmth and a firm hand when needed. This heartfelt description of her father begins as such: ""Although he is a big man with a gruff voice which spouts curse words at regular intervals, he has a heart that envelopes everyone around him. I have seen him quiet a whimpering small child and save a grown man's life."" and by the end of this short loving bit of prose: ""Of all the persons I've known, this man has influenced me the most, not only because he is my daddy but because he is also my friend, who laughs and jokes with me, and my guide, who gives me advice and warns me about the world. Daddy may be a stern and severe father at times, but most of the time he is my ""Freckled Atlas"" who looks after me and loves me."" Reading this while I bear no ties to the family of my friend the love and adoration our friends mother held for his grandfather brought a tear to my eye and reminded me of something incredibly important. Ancestor Veneration Begins with the Living. Remind your parents, your grandparents and all of your family how much they mean to you. They may not be here tomorrow, you may not be here tomorrow, but that love between each other will. @Hyperborean Radio (Uncensored)",2023-10-10 17:51:28+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/4104,,,592,0,8,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2023-10-10 17:15:37,2023-10-10,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/11282,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cthulhu, The Great Dreamer, The Sleeper of R'lyeh, High Priest of the Great Old Ones, The Star Spwan, Lord of the Watery Abyss, The Sleeping God. He who fought a war in the ancient days with ancient beings that make man quiver and quake, who is tended to by Deep Ones and Shape Shifting Starspawn Eldritch Beings, sleeping in the great sunken city of R'lyeh. With cultists across the world and beyond. But while often treated as evil it is more accurate to define Cthulhu as indifferent, an indifferent god at best mildly amused by the tiny mice upon the planet he conquered so long ago. Cthulhu can also be seen in many Lovecraftian games and stories influencing Pirates of the Caribbean, Bloodborne and Other Souls Games, Hellboy, D&D and an endless series of Lovecraftian and cosmic horror. Shub-Niggurath, Hastur and Nyarlathotep all tied for second with 9% unsurprisingly, though I will admit I expected Azathoth to do better.",2023-10-08 16:47:18+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/4086,,,633,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,video/mp4,4.978788890535003e+18,6.101,Cthulhu Gif.gif.mp4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He were a beast of a man, strong as an ox, a bronzed hide, his beard and hair grew long and wild and neath his hat were piercing eyes. He carried a tome of sacred knowledge, his sack was full of forest medicine. He ran with wolves, fought serpents and Indians. He was even betrothed to Forest Maidens, old spirits of the wood. Though perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself, let's start at the beginning shall we. Born at the birth of our Nation he was, grew up crowded on all sides. He'd move this way or that and run into his brother or sister. So when the Pioneers flowed west he naturally followed suit quickly getting ahead of them into a land of Mountain Men, River Rats and Forest Warfare. Travelin' barefoot his feet quickly cobbled his own boots of flesh, he could walk through both fire and ice on those feet of his. Even red hot pokers could not pierce them. He had nothing but the clothes nature grew for him or the tattered remains of Christian Charity while in the wilderness. He'd meet and make friends with many Varmints, took a wolf as traveling companion, some even say he crossed paths with Paul and Babe planting his Orchards all across the frontier and doing battle with Indians, Snakes and British Soldiers. The Forest was wilder then, full to the brim with spirits and wonders. The Indians came to view him as a Holy Man a Heathen Hermit or Forest God. At some point the spirits of the Forest came to him and he became betrothed to some of their maidens, though he refused them in life they could have him in death. Yes there is much much more to Johnny than just his apples. I spect he forgot more than most than us'll ever know. In his death he knew his work weren't over and he bent a tree to plant itself and then all the apples across America. In death he dint cease, when he went on ta' the realms beyond he planted a heavenly orchard that you see in the clouds to this day. @Hyperborean Radio (Uncensored)",2023-09-26 17:51:50+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/4032,,,567,0,11,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2023-09-26 16:05:55,2023-09-26,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/11244,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My knife is my best friend. It is my life."" Since the time of antiquity the right to be armed with a blade has been a symbol of the Free Man. A reflection of the man who possesses it worn proudly for all to see, proving not only his ability and willingness to defend himself and kin but more importantly proof that he is responsible enough to develop a trade. Whether his trade be butchery, rope making, fishing or killing, knives are first and foremost a tool. A hunting knife is not the same as a chef's knife or a fishing knife, nor should they be. Each knife serves a distinct purpose, the purpose of the one who possesses it. The supposed soul of the knife is in reality a reflection of the man holding it. The one who maintains it well, cherishing it for the purpose it serves as well as for what it means, it's history. If the blade is well crafted and cared for it very well may pass on to our grandchildren and our grandchildren's grandchildren. The humble knife passing from father to son, woodworker to woodworker, hunter to hunter. A symbol of Trade. A symbol of Purpose.

msg_iteration.2077.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.3997,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,3997,,"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe... Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion... I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain... Time to die. — Roy Batty, Blade Runner Most people miss the point of this short yet poignant dialogue. They think it is JUST an exploration of 'What it means to be human' or 'What it means to be alive'. Others think it is a question of conscience concerning artificial intelligence and what that means. Can AI become conscious? Can AI become sentient? And what does that mean? I would argue that Roy Batty is a stand in for the path that humanity is on. While Rick Deckard is the stand in for those herding the sheep; whether or not they are aware of their role matters not. It is inconsequential to the the real question raised by these most eloquent 42 words in cinema in the most enigmatic way. No, I would argue that it is 'WE' the regular people, the regular people whose lives are so very, very short. Those who are expected to do no more than labor and toil, to suffer for our 'betters', to live and to die for them at their whim and will. It is 'We' who are represented in a dying machine... just an outdated cog, used, chewed up, spat out with distaste and disgust... Yet it is WE who are truly alive. Those of us who have suffered, who have toiled, who have put others before ourselves who have TRULY lived. It is WE who have seen the 'Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion... I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate.'! WE who can see the wonders in the world for those with eyes to see them. It is WE who gaze in mysterious wonder and awe at the simple elegance of life. But should we not have family. Should we not have friends. Should there be no one to remember us and all of our glories and wonders! ...'All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain...', they shall amount to nothing and soon be forgot. This is why we must live to inspire! To invite people into our lives! To be that which most have been taught is impossible to be! We the Noble and the Brave, the Kind and the Brutal. We can also be the most loving. If it is not we who can understand their heartbreak... their sorrow... then who can? Do not fear, set forth, reach out, do not hold your tongue for fear of offending. But do so with care, care for those who are lost. Love them. Some will run, some will wander away. And that is ok, but try. Say hello, smile in greeting to those of our tribes, become the Man or Woman that others swear in their weakness cannot exist. Do not fear to ask others into your life. Create families and clans. Remember the rules of hospitality so that we might not complete our journey alone as Roy Batty did and so many others of our kind. Text by J.A.

Their short stout stature and thick pelt of snow white hair from the neck down replete with an incredibly thick beard that falls to their waist is well suited to their preferred habitat. Their crowing feature however is ironically at the bottom of their build, that being their hirsute hobbitish feet large enough to act as snowshoes atop the packed snow and long enough to act as skis for fast travel through the mountains. These playful winter spirits have lived atop the French Alps for ages where they tunnel through the snow and ""allegedly"" cause avalanches. They will also whistle to warn shepherds when storms or aforementioned avalanches are occurring, as well as use their exceptional burrowing abilities to help rescue unfortunate souls buried in the oncoming snow. The Barbegazi are at least somewhat fond of Mankind as they bothered to follow their unfortunately bald and lanky neighbors to the New World settling alongside them in Midwestern Mountain Ranges from the Sawtooth Mountains of Minnesota east to the Mountains of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Here they are known colloquially as Snow Goblins or Snow Dwarfs, though they possess many other names as well. Small statues of them dot the land and their playful demeanors are on full display in local myth and legend. Often throwing snow from trees at passersby, the harmless fun typical of such spirits complete with a more extreme deadly version of snowfall should the person have earned the ire of these winter Gods. But regardless they contently traverse their mountains those of the Old World and of the New, their wintery mountain homes fitting them as snuggly as their nonexistent snowshoes. @Hyperborean Radio (Uncensored)",2023-09-16 14:57:57+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/3985,,,761,0,5,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2023-09-14 16:59:52,2023-09-14,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/11218,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.2114.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.3960,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,3960,,"On Politics and Universalism If you were to contrast the systems of what we may call Paganism or ""Ethnic Way"" against what we may call Oneness or ""Universalistic Systems of Belief"" you would find more differences than similarities, though this is in their undiluted state and not the endless amalgam of folk belief and academic conjecture that so permeates both. To start, Paganism actually embraces and in many ways IS FOLK BELIEF. With literary and theological works only appearing as dogmatic texts long after the actual beliefs, concepts and ideas have already been developed and pressure tested. While on the other hand Oneness is the exact opposite, it starts with what is intended to be a constant system of belief. But in reality is often shifted depending on the political climate of the time and merely tolerates folk belief and different schools of thought in so far as it allows it to grow in power and influence. Regardless of the corruption or synthesis with other conflicting ideals. The second is while Oneness often states itself as the one universalistic truth. Paganism does not. Rather Pagan beliefs are often specific to a people and contain among other things their history, culture and divine beings that populate both. In its undiluted state Paganism is unique to a tribe and is expressed on an individual level. The all-powerful, all-pervading and one true God or Gods that are present in later stages to some degree are typically a central tenant of Oneness. The reason for them and their often moralizing lessons is simple, they arise when enough tribes get together and are often a corruption of a deity or deities from the tribes that make them up. Mankind is inherently incredibly tribal so conflict is inevitable especially when forced to work together with disparate groups who most likely have considerable animosity over everything from wars to broken hearts. Thus this deity or set of deities serves as the watcher and controller, not because this deity ever was or even is such a thing, but because the political powers decreed it as useful. Because once any level of ones Ethnic Way is handed away from the people and instead given to an outside authority. The Gods once a treasured member of the culture and people, instead become a cudgel with which to force the people to submit. Thus the all powerful god that ages of people have died for is little more than the political tool of an overclass. Oneness is politics, nothing more. From this spawns political ideologies where eventually as technology and empires grow the powers that may be find other means of keeping the people in line. Religious Dogma is replaced with political dogma, the all seeing deity is replaced with cameras and informants. The Government is the All Seeing God whether he calls himself the Pope or President. However Paganism should not be confused with the idea of lack of innovation, or a sort of backwards state of living. But rather a rejection of control, confederations of hundreds if not thousands of tribes have banded together before without having to conflate their Gods or make any of them the all powerful, ""ONE TRUE GOD"". In fact these confederations existed for millennia and even conquered Rome on several occasions. Though it is now known as an empire it was nothing like what one would think. It is called the Celtic Empire. The choice is not the stone age or totalitarianism, nor is it the eternal inquisition of whose brand of Oneness is the correct choice. The choice is as it always has been. Are we true to ourselves or do we join the herd? The One True is merely the oldest of control options. Each and every one of our tribes have our own Gods, traditions and ways of being. An inheritance of mythic proportions. Or we can follow the shepherd to safety and slavery whether he wears a Crucifix, a Mjolnir or a Party Membership Badge. But know we don't have to play their game anymore. We never really did. @Hyperborean Radio (Uncensored)",2023-09-08 17:00:27+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/3960,,,685,0,11,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2023-09-08 16:29:08,2023-09-08,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/11207,0,,,1,MessageMediaWebPage,1,https://open.spotify.com/episode/6Zpmh8xNwhF19f6lIkUZBy,open.spotify.com,Devilish,"Listen to this episode from Hyperborean Radio (Uncensored) on Spotify.

The answer is heartbreaking in its simplicity. Instinctively these people are SUPPOSED to represent the best of the people. They are SUPPOSED to be our heroes and champions like in the tales of old. They are SUPPOSED to represent the likes of King Arthur, Robin Hood, The Bear King, The Warrior Chieftains and his hordes of heroes, The Marauder King and his men taking down corrupt Kings, William Wallace, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Davy Crocket, James Bowie, Doc Holiday, Wyatt Earp, Boudica and her hordes, Joan of Arc, Otto Von Bismark, and many many more. We understand they are SUPPOSED to protect us and defend us from the darkness and corruption of the greedy and selfish. They are SUPPOSED to be HEROES among men. The selfless, courageous, steadfast, honorable. This is why faith is constantly placed in these MONSTERS currently in control who manipulate, extort, coerce and BETRAY the people. The BETRAYAL of the people and their hopes. It isn't supposed to be this way and we know it. We are a meritocratic people by nature ONLY THE BEST reaching positions of nobility and honor, a glowing God among men, this is not the world we live in. Many are still blinded to it and so continue on placing their faith in those who do not deserve it in the HOPES that they will be saved by those same individuals that break the unspoken pact, those who ""simply follow orders"" or are busy ""Just doing my job"". ""Faith"" is blind... and foolish, it is the weapon used against the people. ""Have faith in the system"", ""Have faith in your leaders"", ""Have faith in..."".

msg_iteration.2215.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.3857,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,3857,,"Why The Radio? In the age of cellphones and computers why did we choose a radio as our symbol? Because the Radio is mundane, an everyday object often overlooked, yet it represents much more. The Radio does not eradicate that which surrounds it, your time is not robbed of you, your attention is not stripped from kin or purpose. The Radio gifts information, it delivers music and discussion, it has been used to broadcast light in darkness, stories of great and daring deeds, war correspondence and conversations between those who may never have met otherwise. Unlike the Neon Lights of the Urban Wastelands and Monitors that dominate the home the Radio never displaced the Hearth from its flaming abode instead it was its amiable neighbor. One could dance with the one they love, knit, whittle or play cowboys with the nearby Radio as congenial companion. As tech expanded from portable radios, to Walkman's, to MP3 Players, to the tiny magic mirrors we carry in our pockets everyday this function remained, at least in its function as a Radio. A walk in the woods, a fishing trip in the family boat, a game of Monopoly that never completes all of these and more can be done ""BESIDE"" The Radio, not in-spite of or in resistance to. The Radio is freedom it is connection by choice, addition without bindings, it is the open road and Sunday nights with Family. This is what Hyperborean Radio aspires to be, an addition in your lives. Without stripping any of the meaning and joys that we have in life. Broadcast for all to hear.

The traditional Spiritual Memory and Outgrowth of a people, their mytho-history, divine family, ancestors, ghosts and customs. When Grandparents tell stories, when holiday customs are passed on to the next generation, a father teaching his son to hunt, a mother teaching her daughter to cook, the legends of their land and clan and any that may have been picked up of use over the years. A Hunt may be a hunt and even end with the age old custom of blowing the hunting horn. It may even involve stories of The Wild Huntsman, The Eternal Hunter, Ullr, Artemis or any number of hunting or woodland deities. But it doesn't have to. People may embody their gods in spirit or simply as role models much as one does with pop culture figures, the surrogate gods and heroes of the modern age. It is in everything we do, while some may have more blatantly pagan customs involving carved masks, Treats left for ancestral spirits or forest gifts. Are any of us here going to deny that all of this is as Normal as we make it? Most of it so typical, so mundane, that we don't even notice it.

msg_iteration.2248.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.3824,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,3824,,"The Odd American Alphabets The United States has its share of odd and obscure history including the invention of new alphabets. Here are three of the more notable examples. Franklin Alphabet: Developed by Benjamin Franklin in 1768 an original American Phonetic Alphabet for a ""More Natural Order"" to writing language. Franklin sought to not only aid in building a national identity but also ""remove bad spelling"" he removed letters he considered redundant like C,J,Q, W, X and Y and also added 6 others of his own design, he gave preference to sounds formed by the Breath as opposed others. While he was able to convert Noah Webster of all people, most others were not so supportive and even ridiculed his alphabet as a corruption of Language and a nightmare for future etymology. Cherokee Syllabary: Invented by the Cherokee Man Sequoyah over 12 years to help his people maintain their language and provide a more fitting alphabet, this Syllabary differed from Latin Alphabets in that it represented the Syllables in the Cherokee Language rather than consonants and vowels. This Syllabary is still in use today in increasingly diverse ways among the Cherokee Tribal areas. Deseret Alphabet: Invented by George D. Watt and born from the Utopian and idealist views of Brigham Young and the Mormon Church the Deseret Alphabet was intended as one of many reforms for the ""Latter Days"" before the second coming of Christ and was intended, much as Franklin's above, to make reading, writing and spelling easier. It never fully took off despite being encouraged to be taught to the young. Some detractors even claim it was meant more to keep Mormon's from reading outside literature than anything else. In recent years it has seen a revival as a Cultural heirloom for Members of the Latter Day Saints Church. How about You?

Lately I don't quite know how to describe it but I haven't been feeling quite as interested in things as usual. I'm not talking depression or anything of the sort, but rather I was watching Television and the thought struck me ""I am watching a bunch of adults get paid absurd amounts of money to play dress up and run around playing pretend"" It became hard to see characters and all I could see were the actors who played them. The immersion, that ability to melt into a film or TV show was gone. It's not much better for Youtube; not that like most people, there are individuals whose content I still enjoy here or there, but I find myself increasingly uninterested in video format and media of any kind. It's like I can feel the time being etched away as I sit in front of the screen. I find myself increasingly more drawn to older things vinyl, radio and books. It's not that I'm against movies, Social Media or Video Games. I just view them as less and less important or prominent in my life, but its more than just not wanting to, its a complete lack of desire. Movies have lost their luster, Social Media the likes of Youtube, Instagram etc seem like a mixture of useful tool and complete time suck where I wake from a daze not knowing what I'd been doing for the last hour. I still; like most people, enjoy music, a good book, time with friends, the outdoors, Radio both classic and the more modern ""podcasts"". In a way its freeing, but the way it happened was odd. It was as if a spell that I'd been under since I was young, enamored and enthralled by screens and fast paced media had completely collapsed and I could walk away whenever I wanted, or use it when I felt like it. I want to post less to Social Media, not just for myself to have more free time, I don't want to take up too much of yours either, time, attention is the most valuable resource we have.

msg_iteration.2288.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.3783,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,3783,,"Results Conclusion: Around 30% of Americans Seem to consider around 75% or less of their diet originates in their State, 50% or More are unaware or consume even more. Interesting... so on my end I'm unaware of how much of my food comes from my state of residence. (nothing unique there) However while I can find Gummy Candy in my state, explicitly made in my state, its hard to find other more obvious things. I live in the Great Lake Region yet Freshwater Fish is hard to find for sale, much of what is fished out of the Great Lakes is sent abroad while this allows for an income it also strips one of the most valued resources, on the same token I use to live in Iowa which despite having the most farmer's markets per capita in the USA is also the epicenter of Big Agriculture, to the point that some have tried to start making Iowan Tofu to utilize the immense amount of Soy grown in Iowa. This doesn't change the fact modern farming in Iowa is stripping the soil in favor of cash crops, mostly due to Federal Policy. I may be overthinking it, seeing shared brands in different states but little to no local food available aside from specialty stores or Farmers Markets is surreal. The world doesn't work like this... yet it does. You can eat Steak from Texas, African Chocolate, Wisconsin Cheese, Maple Syrup from Canada all in the same dish in Indiana (What the ever loving Fuck are you eating? ahem...) While this is a marvel of the modern world it is also horrifying, the amount of biomass lost or moved, culture loss, and just genuine loss of resources is insane. Which is why I was curious as to how much the average American got from the local state. All 50 States are in theory meant to be individual countries and they seem to be set up more akin to counties. While many States are larger than all of the UK! Maybe I'm just overthinking it but I wonder how stable this is and who will bare the costs when a worldwide food system faces its inevitable collapse. Which states, Which individuals, will thrive and which will starve?",2023-07-28 02:58:23+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/3783,,,930,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,video/mp4,5.051097473871775e+18,2.071,American Food Gif.gif.mp4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's strong herds that once stretched as far as the eye could see, its delicious meat, powerful gait and wild beard and horns, but quite possibly while the Bald Eagle may be iconic, the Bison is important. It had immense impact on our history, our culture, we even call it ""Gods Cattle"" While the East Coast doesn't tend to have Bison, for most US States from Appalachia to the Western Edge of the Rockies this wondrous Beast, this manifested God of Storms in its booming rumble has made a mark on all who've seen it. We did not nearly drive these to extinction, they were nearly wiped out when Amerindians drove whole herds over canyons in their ""Bison Runs"" No... We were the ones who SAVED THEM! Much as beautiful Columbia was replaced with Uncle Sam -Though this was a mistake imo- Perhaps its time for the US to shift its focus to a Beast that embodies our dreams, our hopes and in some ways our history.

msg_iteration.2321.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.3750,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,3750,,"Did They? It is often thought that the Church ""won""; that it replaced the Heathen Gods and Ancestral Customs with a new religion complete with doctrine, dogma and a crushing political structure. While I do not dispute this importation of Doctrine, this enforcement of Dogma, nor the Political Empire stemming from the Church halfway across the world... I have to wonder ""Did they?"" Did they erase the veneration of Heathen Gods? Did they erase the folk culture and beliefs of the people involved? I mean they definitely tried, but look around, how well did they do? Just from the obvious bits they missed from the ancestor veneration of Halloween and the Yuletide, to the fertility customs of Easter and May Day; it's not any secret that they did a rather poor job of eradicating these heretical acts. And I'm just getting started! That's merely in America and I haven't even gotten to our Lumberjack Forest Gods or Ghost Riders in the Sky. Across the Pond back to the Old Country it's no secret that many areas even to this day have a local wise elder, or to dispense with pleasantries a ""Local Witch"" whether male or female is rather superfluous. Their own holy buildings which are blasphemous in and of themselves, are useful only as a political seat, even if such a use is now merely a dwindled formality rather than the real power it once exercised. The Green Man, Protective Spirits known now as Gargoyles and the Masturbating Fertility Gnomes known as Sheela and Sean na Gig stare unabashed from chapel rafters. We still have more tales than we can count of Puck, Holda, Thor, Basa Jaun, The Leshy among many many other Gods. Though occasionally they are in fancy dress and misnamed Mary, Michael or some such surrogate name of blasphemous belief. All they managed was to twist these beliefs, adding biblical gunk to the gears. So I ask again... Did they? Or did they only convince us they won, so we would stop fighting for what they could never destroy?-HR @Hyperborean Radio (Uncensored)",2023-07-16 22:09:58+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/3750,,,686,0,10,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2023-07-16 15:49:48,2023-07-16,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/11106,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.2364.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.3707,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,3707,,"Nine More English Words With Pagan Meanings Automaton: An Automaton is a living object in Greek Myth, the most famous is Talos a bronze man filled with Ichor who guarded Crete. While Automaton is oft used as a steampunk equivalent to Robot this is a falsehood as the two words are diametrically opposed. Robot means ""Slave"" while Automaton means to ""Imbue with Free Will"" or a sense of self. A stark contrast between our current age and the mindset of the Ancients. Example: Talos, Gullinbursti, Pinocchio, Manannán's Horse/Boat Eldritch: While Eldritch is often synonymous with Lovecraftian Cosmic Horror or the Abyss the words origin is actually ""Elf Kingdom"" or ""Fairyland"" Thus the word Eldritch implies it finds its origins in the strange ways of the Otherworlds and realms, specifically the Wyrd ways of the lands of Fae and Elphame. Example: ""This Elf Stone radiates Eldritch Qualities"". Oneironaut: Oneironauts are travelers within dreams, both in a visionary sense or in an innate ability to project ones consciousness or spirit out of their body during dreaming. Whether between realms or dreams. Example: Inception or A Christmas Carol, ""The Oneironaut traveled through the Dreamlands and came to the Realm of the Dead"" Kind: Kind is a wonderful word still used today. To be Kind, or of a Kind is to be of the same race, nation, character or nature. Kindness or the act of being Kind is to exemplify the most noble natures of your Kind. A wonderful multifaceted word with many implications. Example: Mankind (The Species of Man/Hyperboreans), Goblinkind, ""Your Kind Deeds shall not soon be forgot"" Craft: One's Craft is ones skill or strength, it is also sometimes used as short hand for the ability to perform miracles or work the Wyrd, among other things. Example: Woodcraft (the Skill or Strength in regards to woodworking), Witchcraft (Craft of Wise Ones), Starcraft (Astrology in its practical use for weather and calendar purposes) Man: Man is us, while A Race of Man currently refers to any Human shaped entity of Middle Earth, the specific word ""Man"" is originally a description of the species indigenous to Northwest Eurasia and related groups. While many epitaphs exist, at our core we are still Man. Note: The sexes were previously demarcated as Wifman and Werman. Seen today in the words Wife or Werewolf. Example: ""From the forest, hewn in song and holy groves, in bears blood and calloused hands the first tribes of Man were born."" Lore: More than tales and legends. Lore is teaching, knowledge, tradition, the ways and whys of a people or craft. Before Lawgivers gave chains of starry thoughts The Lore ruled the nature and traditions of Man and was how we passed down who we were, the guidelines and warnings to go with the inheritance of Flesh and soul. Example: Sealore (Teachings/Knowledge of the Sea), Woodlore (Lore of the Woods), Battlelore (Lore of Battle and War) Petrichor: The Smell of Dust after it rains, though it is constructed from words that translate it to the Blood of the Gods among the stones, a reference to not only the wonders of the ethereal experience of the scent of Earth after the gift of rain but that most sacred of elements... water. Example: The rapturous scent of Petrichor filled the spring morn as the trees seemed more radiant and otherworldly than at any other time of the year. Rapture: Often the result of a state of extreme emotion, frequently used akin to the similar word Ecstasy. Referring to an intense emotional state of elation or excitement wherein one is ""carried off""; their consciousness seeming to drift from its normal place of function. Time and space seem less defined in this state. Note: American Christian Teachings abscond with this word often used in reference to the second coming of Christ, but it is not theirs to use. Example: Her Rapturous Experience washed over her, she was never the same after that.

A place of rituals, enchantment and untold legends. But what was Stonehenge used for? Why, We Still Build Them Today! Stonehenge was used for the same thing all monuments of its design are used for... performance! Music, Speeches, Plays all those wondrous things Mankind has found to connect, discuss, revel and entertain ourselves. For Stonehenge's greatest secret... is its wonderful acoustics. Shaped as it is as an Amphitheater, even without a top, sound behaves in a weird fashion within its stone circles. It is not unlikely that a roof of wood, cloth or leather may have covered it at one point creating a dome with which sound may travel far further out to the revelers. Similar structures were built by the Romans such as the Colosseum or Arles Amphitheater in France -depicted in the top right corner- While this may seem farfetched our people have always celebrated events both festive and political with music and merriment and to do that you need good acoustics. While a Valley or hastily constructed amphitheater may do, natural Amphitheaters like Monserrat in Spain and Red Rocks in Colorado -depicted on the bottom- are places our people are especially drawn to for revelry from the moment we realize its acoustic potential. Sadly not everyone is so lucky as to have The Gods carve one for them, so we often build our own. From Cathedrals to Football Stadiums, Fourth of July Concerts to Congressional Halls acoustics have long been a factor in the most important of our buildings and events.

Whose experiences exploring the mostly unexplored Western USA along the Green and Colorado Rivers would radically change him, inspiring him of the necessity of what came to be called ""Watershed Democracy"" yet what is that and who is this bearded bestial looking man anyway? Born in Mount Morris, New York in the Spring of 1834 Powell went on to fight in the Civil War where he lost most of his right arm from a Minié ball at the Battle of Shiloh, forever leaving him with but a stump where his arm used to be. Not long after he would lead several expeditions to chart the West, though they were perilous, one he undertook with ten men and several rowboats down the Green and Colorado Rivers. Only to come out in the end with 6 half naked men and a few pounds of moldy flour between them. He'd become an American Hero but was forever changed by his experiences. After his expeditions, he advocated that America must carefully settle the West as unlike the bounty of the Mississippi and Great Lakes that the East has, most of the West was a Desert. Using a combination of Mountains, Forests and Rivers of the Land he and his team charted the Western Watersheds and advocated State and Country Boundaries to be based around these natural land marks to avoid conflict and the destruction of the Land. However between his stubborn, wild and passionate demeanor and the fact he was going against the Narrative of the Time of the endless bounties of the West and of Gods divine intent for America his ideas were rejected and most senators of the time ended up detesting Powell and his ideas. Yet one wonders what may have happened had his idea been heeded, how different the map would be? Would the Dust Bowl Never happen? Would the Colorado River still charge forth into Mexico? No one can deny, his prediction of the conflict wrought by the scarce water of the West was all too prophetic.",2023-06-25 00:10:02+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/3666,,,2073,0,53,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our Holidays have many functions not least of which is the bringing together of community and perhaps the conception of new families, yet one that has fallen from common practice are the various traditions of Midsummer. So ingrained is one of these customs that our women practice it on instinct from girlhood. The Flower Wreathe. This long held custom is not simply about the creation of a trifling trinket, rather it is a declaration of intent, of affection and of a hope for something more. Upon Midsummer whatever name it wears the women make their Floral Crowns and should a man meet their measures she shall gift of him her wreathe. There are many customs that follow from giving her his Oak wreathe, returning hers to many others to indicate that he reciprocates. Yet a Great Man may receive many wreathes but now that the intent of the Woman is known it is to the Man to decide how this shall proceed. Does it end here, a summer crush, or does he embrace her? Should he accept, then across the year they may find themselves courting; testing each other and their kin. Becoming engaged in that practice marriage where a babe is conceived and skills are put on trial. Then through Procession and Gauntlet, oaths are exchanged and a family grows.

The current oldest Bristlecone Pine is Methuselah whose location is kept secret so as to avoid harm to the over 4,800 Year Old Tree. But there was once an older Bristlecone Pine known as Prometheus who was around 4,900 Years Old. Then Graduate Student Donald R. Currey was researching the Little Ice Age and with the Forestry Service gained permission to core the trees however... while stories vary and there is vast controversy surrounding it Currey's Increment borer broke and he received permission to fell the tree to access its rings. It was only then that they realized they had cut down one of if not the oldest tree in the Western Hemisphere.

Description: ""Beetles are about 1-½ to 2-½ inches long and colored yellowish or greenish-gray with brown to black spots, rarely are they reddish- brown. Males have three projections on the shield behind the head (pronotum) with the central one the longest and nearly meeting an additional projection on the head. Females have only small raised area (tubercles) in place of the horns. Larvae are large C-shaped grubs like huge June beetles. There are many other species of scarab beetles in Texas. The name rhinoceros beetle has been used for this species as well as the close relatives. However, the name now appropriately is applied to Xyloryctes jamaicensis (Drury). This is a dark brown species about 1 inch long and with a single long upright horn on the head of the males. Females have a small tubercle instead of a horn. Larvae feed on roots of ash trees. The ox or elephant beetles, Strategus sp., are large (up to 2 inches long), brown rhinoceros beetles (Dynastinae). Males have three horns behind the head (on the pronotum). Immature stages look like very large white grubs and can be found in compost heaps or occasionally infest potting media.""-Texas A&M",2023-06-08 13:54:20+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/3593,,,811,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The total length is from 161-191 mm. Birth occurs between March and August with females producing 1 litter per year of 3-7 young. They are diurnal and nocturnal, gregarious and perhaps colonial. Burrows are found in marshy or riparian areas. They are 3-6 cm in height, and located 3-60 cm below the surface, often with an underwater opening. The nests are located above the high water flooding level, and are composed of dead leaves, straw, and dead grasses. They are limited by the loss of suitable habitat (moist, boggy soil, humus, sandy loam, marshes, swamps, along streams). Predators include: large fish, red-tailed hawk, great horned owls, screech owls, long-eared owls, barn owls, skunks, weasels, and cats. is a small mole found in moist, low areas in the northern parts of North America.""-Virginia DWR",2023-06-05 00:10:40+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/3574,,,979,0,10,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Memorial Day or Decoration day is a Federal Holiday in the USA where one honors and remembers the lives and sacrifices of the Fallen of our various wars. But where did it begin? After the Civil War there was a call for a National Day of remembrance for the many who lost their lives in the bloody conflict on both sides, May 30th was initially chosen because flowers were in full bloom and it was not the anniversary of a particular battle. Once known as Decoration Day due to the custom of decorating the graves of slain soldiers. Eventually conforming to Industrial/Federal schedules it was moved to the last Monday of May where it remains to this day despite contention. After WW1 the day began to honor all American soldiers slain in war. For those who have personally lost loved ones Memorial Day remains a Solemn occasion, while for others it has become the first day of summer a time for BBQ's, Picnics, Camping and Travel. A Day of the Dead in general. Yet this is not the whole story... Memorial Day stems from customs of graveyard picnics beside flowers and folk art adorned headstones freshly cleaned by loving hands where tales are told of the beloved dead amidst both mourning and celebration. A Vernal All Souls Day once known by many names became Memorial Day, yet in place of Witches and May Trees stand Soldiers and Flagpoles. Some decry the Summer Joys as a lack of Solemnity of a day to honor fallen heroes. But in truth this is a day to celebrate hope paid for in the blood of our Forefathers. Represented in the Poppy, each bloom a drop of heroes blood from a thousand thousand battlefields. So remember the fallen, but do not forget the living. Each child taught of the price paid in blood will carry the flame of our people within their hands.

There has been an ongoing battle, a war for the Soul of America, for ""The American Spirit"". I am not referring to the oft declared war between Good and Evil, or any machinations of the Devil. No this battle is much more shades of Green than black and white. The battle between the freedom to be as we may and that of a controlling overarching doctrine. One could call it the war of the Pagan vs the Puritan. Though it is more complicated than that. While we are often told of The Quakers and The Pilgrims, we are rarely told of the Mountain Folk or the ""Werewolves and Witches"" who escaped the flames of Europe and brought their Wild Hearts to American Shores. We are told of ""In God We Trust"" but rarely its precursors of ""E Pluribus Unum"" or ""Mind Your Business"". But if you dig a bit deeper you find centuries of warring ideas, the heathen-like Cedar cutters forced off their hard won homes by would be land barons, the Mountain Folk of Appalachia forcing away the IRS or National Guard. Stories of Old West Psychopomps that take the form of Undertakers, Forest God Lumberjacks, Giant Sailors Atop Clouds, or of the Fallen Warriors Who Dwell in the Meadows of Fiddlers Green, of a God of Liberty who came to Washington, Veneration of the Beloved God Columbia, of a Deified Pioneer or Mountain Men Hermits and Wild Berserkers, of River Gods and Freshwater Faeries, of Dogmen who fought in the civil war, of ancient blond and red haired bear men, of flying Yuletide Elves and Ghost Riders in the Sky.

A wooden or ivory facsimile of the divine with which many grand adventures were had! A popular gift at Saturnalia and Yule from long ago to this very day. When the boys came of age or the girls married they would ask the Gods to bless their toys, these childhood treasures eventually passed on or ritualistically destroyed as many of us did with our beloved wooden and plastic friends. A rite of passage that has never left us until perhaps recently... Yet we can truly return these childhood idols of Gods and Man once more to enliven that most sacred of gifts, the game of childhood.

This love is to be found in your Sons. While it is true a Son might grow to dislike his Mother; love and like being two different things. But you can rest assured he will ALWAYS love his Mommy, without reservation. There is not a Son among the Hyperborean people; child or grown, that would not move the world to save his Mommy or even raise every last inch of it shaking the very roots of the Earth itself in vengeance of her. He will love her completely and truly for the entirety of his life from his first wail to his last gasp, even after she is gone. So raise your sons well! Be gentle with him. Guard his heart so that he might not become cruel, but remember; You are raising a Man. A child brought into this world through countless ages of great hardship and even greater joys, by you! Born and bred of love, a love whose sole purpose is to defend his people with the same vigor he would defend you. To safeguard the vulnerable but not the weak, to teach the lessons he has learned throughout his life so that those under his protection might thrive. So teach him well. Teach him the respect he is due and the responsibilities he must bear. Teach him of sacrifice and love. Teach him his value so that he might not settle, nor demand more than is his due. Teach him both his own value and the value of others. Teach him to think for himself. To question. To understand and see the world around him. Teach him a little rebellion is good for the soul of a Man and to be expected. But also teach him where to draw the line. To give respect but to demand it in return! Remember he's not the shield, nor is he the spear. He is the man who wields these tools! Not the tool to be wielded... Remember it's only through you he will learn what a woman SHOULD be, so be noble. Remember he will one day demand your example of womanhood in a wife of his own. A Woman who will in turn give you Grandchildren who will also honor their Grandmother; or not, in the same way he himself had been taught by you. Become honored. Raise your sons well. Raise them with the dignity and pride only a Mother can have in her Sons! Happy Mothers Day. We Will Always Love You Your Sons The Hyperborean Men of the World.

The main goal of the cartoon is to glorify the capitalism and the free enterprise system. The film does a great job of demonstrating the basic concepts of capitalism. It explains how business and competition works. It says that we pay taxes to have schools, hospitals, roads, fire and police departments, aid to the needy and obviously national defense. It also says that we shouldn't want the government to provide non essential services since they have to be paid for by higher taxes. The film was produced by John Sutherland. The Freedoms Foundation awarded the film its gold honor medal as ""the best film developed in the United States during 1954 to further better understanding of the American way of life"". HISTORICAL BACKGROUND / CONTEXT After World War 2 nuclear anxiety, anti-Communism and international political realignments fueled the Cold War-era United States and turned the country's media landscape into a battleground from the late 1940s on. In the press, on the radio, and increasingly through the newly emerging medium of television, business and labor struggled for power over the national consciousness. These opposing forces fought to redefine the economic structure of the American nation. To most working people, postwar ""normalcy"" meant a final farewell to Depression-induced privation, access to consumer goods unavailable during the war years, and a redistribution of the economic pie through the newly powerful labor movement. To business, however, the end of hostilities promised freedom from New Deal liberalism. Corporations sought an end to planning and government influence, to communist, socialist and labor movements, and above all, shrinkage of the public sector, swollen in sixteen years of economic depression and war. Both sides characterized their points of view as patriotic and their opponents as un-American. Business fought for influence through organizations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Their intentions were presented as lofty and neutral: to educate Americans about their economic system and its benefits. Launching a giant propaganda offensive, these organizations pumped out press releases, published books, organized public and private meetings, bought advertising and produced motion pictures. Differences between capitalism and communism: Capitalism and communism are two political theories which can be stated as the complete opposite of one another as their fundamental ideologies contrast each other in the most prominent ways. Capitalism can best be defined as a financial and a social system that recognizes individual property rights, individual consumption and approves of the private ownership of capital. It gave rise to the industrialization and is based on the rights of the individual and allows individuals unlimited opportunities in creating wealth for themselves. Capitalism also encourages the individual to own as much property and goods that they can afford to buy which in turn results in inequality. This inequality then results in each citizen striving to accumulate more wealth in order to stand above the rest and yet, each individual is supposed to respect the rights of other individuals. The citizens of a capitalist society are provided with equal opportunity when competing as sellers or buyers of goods or property, with the government playing no part in it except setting up certain rules and regulations regarding the process. Capitalism is honest competition and letting the marketplace decide who has the better product for better prices and one sees no oppression of the individual here as a result. Communism is based on the belief that individual gain must be scarified in order to achieve collective gain. Thus…",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our answers when it comes to research are often of the nature of studying ones ancestry, local lore and customs. But in terms of the more important part the ""LIVING"" part well that's a bit more complicated and often may come across as a non-answer. Live. Be Noble, Be Strong, Be Brave, Be Wise but above all truly live. Many who follow our broadcast and posts closely have taken that advice to heart. Such as one Spiffy Acorn, who has been so kind as to share photos he took while on his adventures. Exalting at the arrival of Spring by the local marker of the return of Hummingbird-Moths. Of joining his group of friends in his passion to rebuild a car as an ongoing project. He goes to the woods finding Osprey perched on branches and keeps his eyes peeled for Pumas or the suspiciously Troll like trees and stones. Among these subtle joys of the day to day he has shared his discoveries, the small, the unexpected and the gleeful with us. These are rather uplifting updates for us especially as things in the modern day seem to cast such a despairing shadow for so many. To know we inspired these small adventures, the forging of the little lights of community and small wonders. Well... It rather brings a smile to our face.

msg_iteration.2669.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.3399,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,3399,,"Roanoke Phantom In the days of the early settlers on the Roanoke River, hunters told tales of the Phantom that inhabited the forest. According to the stories, the phantom had once been a man of flesh and bone, whose wife and child had been killed by the Moratoc Indians. From that day forward, his passion was vengeance. It was a passion that left its mark on the forest for centuries to come. The phantom was described as being seven feet tall, with a bushy, black beard. He carries a knife in each hand, with a third cleaned between his teeth. Fearsome as this image may be, it's the eyes that are seen first, glowing red with fury. As one story goes, the Moratoc were attacking a white settlement, setting it ablaze and killing anyone they saw as a threat. The Moratoc were known for taking able-bodied women and children as slaves. The sun was barely peaking over the treetops as the savages led their bound captives along the river the next morning. Suddenly, a thick fog began to form around them. The settlers could hardly see 6 inches in front of them through the haze, and they all froze in place when they heard the agonizing, gurgling screams of their captors. Then everything went quiet. Not even the frogs were singing now. After a few moments, one set of heavy footsteps began approaching the women and their terrified children. They could not make out any image of what was standing in front of them, but out of the fog came a voice. It was strong and comforting, ""Do not be afraid,"" it said. Suddenly the ropes binding them fell to the earth. ""Go now. Return home. They will not trouble you again."" Later, when the women told their account, they said that after the voice spoke to them, the fog lifted. They were astonished to find that the Indians lay dead, all around them. Their throats had been cut. Their hero was never seen, but for many decades since, stories persisted of the fierce phantom, watching over the settlers as they prospered in a new life.",2023-04-24 01:20:16+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/3399,,,717,0,12,1,PeerChannel,1708539788.0,storytellingtradition,2023-04-11 06:55:03,2023-04-11,https://t.me/storytellingtradition/710,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In folk traditions, it was made into tea to treat stomach upset and constipation. This tea can also be beneficial for kidney issues and “ailments or rupture” related to the uterus. A poultice of the root is used for cancer. The Cherokee cooked young growth and leaves parboiled, fried, or mixed with other greens. The secretion from the mashed leaves can be used to treat bug bites and scratches. ""The entire plant is edible. The flowers and leaves can be eaten raw and added to salads. The leaves can also be added to soups, omelets and stir-fry. The stems can be braised or roasted like asparagus.

msg_iteration.2696.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.3372,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,3372,,"Heathenry Heathenry is not a religion, nor is it a philosophy; it is something else entirely, something more, more important, more integral to mankind than any mere belief system could ever be. And it's all in the name. A Heathen is ""Of the Heath' 'An Inhabitant of Open Country"" In short a country person specifically one connected with the land and the people on it. The bone and blood that fills the soil, the trees planted by their ancestors centuries before. They know the path of the creek, the nature of the trees, the mark of the mountains, the stories of the stones and valleys. The reason Heathen became synonymous with the Old Ways, Paganism or ""Ethnic Faith"" is because the countryside is the place where the beliefs, stories, customs, history and wisdom of the people is most well protected. Here the beliefs of the Church's Religion ebb and sway falling away nearly as fast as they come up. Instead songs sung in the pub, the naming of children to cheering crowds, reading the sun and the wind to find the storms who may come for the wheat or sink the fishing fleets. Such is the Heathen that they know their land, they know their community; its history, its nature and how it all interacts. When Heathens fade from this world they take comfort in having lived a life with those they held most dear as their flesh joins the ancestors in the soil and the sea, one once more with the land and folk they so treasured while alive. Whether they believe they walk to the embrace of their forefathers or oblivion; they find comfort in knowing they truly lived. This is why Heathenry is not a religion, it is so much more. To lack this most fundamental need of Mankind is to continually feel as though something is missing. The embrace of loved ones and hallowed earth. It is why as long as we breathe who we are, our old ways will never die.

Well turns out they do! The results are hilarious and amazing! Popular themes include 50's Diners, Cowboys, Steakhouse, Texan, BBQ, Burgers, Midwest or Sports Bar. Though Amerindian, Surfer and well known city dishes also happen. Japan has several including Bronco BIlly's serving famous American dishes like “I stewed the Bronco hamburger and beef muscle meat of collagen plentiful.” & who can forget traditional American Bacon boiled and served in the water it was boiled in just like Mom's. There is Indiana Café in Paris which serves Traditional Hoosier Cuisine or Tex-Mex, order classic items like Nachos Indiana if you're feeling homesick. There are also chains such as Ireland's Eddie Rocket's which serves 50's Diner fare though if you want extra cheese you'll need to use the American phrase of ""Pimped-Up"" to let them know. Quite possibly one of the most beloved institutions and birthday party destination is Spur Steak Ranch with an Amerindian theme whose menu includes varieties of traditional American Schnitzel with Mushroom Soup atop it, Spur is beloved across South Africa. There's Old Wild West in Italy a bizarro Olive Garden. Moscow has Beverly Hills Diner complete with a Pulp fiction dance performed by staff to really make you feel American beside statues of Elvis and Betty Boop. As much as I may seem to be mocking these restaurants I actually love them! Americans don't tend to realize how unique our food is and often downplay it. In these restaurants abroad I am reminded of how interesting our culture can be via outside eyes. From Memphis Diner in Paris to the Yellow Rose of Texas in Peru if you're ever nearby and in need of a steak, burger, brownie, malt, pizza, chili or any other American Dish stop in. Just don't expect it to be quite what you'd get at home. Oh and American Cuisine abroad is quite expensive so you may want to save up first.",2023-04-16 00:09:52+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/3360,,,1711,0,39,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Joined by Spock, McCoy, Sulu, Uhura, Chekhov and of course Scotty but there is always that burning question... where was he born? Well! It turns out there is an answer to this oh so very important question! He will be born in Riverside, Iowa on March 22, 2233 (or as the sign says March 22, 2228 Canon is a funny thing) so how did this come to be? Well Kirk was always from Iowa or at least as soon as a rough idea of where he was from was presented in ""The Making of Star Trek"" and its' Biography of Kirk mentioned he was from a small town in Iowa. This was most likely due to Iowa being considered quintessential Middle America Old McDonald Smalltown Cornland in the general mindset of Americans. Anyway where was I... oh yeah how it became official. Well a local Star Trek Fan Steve Miller decided to put it to a vote at the town council to change their annual river festival to Trekfest and claim to be the Birthplace of Captain Kirk. To Miller's surprise the motion passed and Trekfest and the birthplace have been canon ever since. With Roddenberry even amused at the enterprising action and was quoted as saying “As far as I’m concerned, the first volunteer has it.” The town even has a parade float modeled after the Enterprise called the U.S.S. Riverside, a Statue of Kirk unveiled in 2018 (Kirk not Shatner) and even sold jars of local soil called ""Kirk Dirt"" which were used as fundraising for the statue. Riversides' Trekfest and all its Nerdy elements continues to this day.

msg_iteration.2750.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.3316,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,3316,,"A Glad Eastertide Happy Eastertide! But not Easter... or maybe Easter. It can be a bit confusing when the Holiday actually is, even though it is quite possibly the easiest of our holidays to pinpoint. No need to worry about Solar or Lunar Calendars, Solstices or Equinox's. Rather you can see Easter with your very eyes all around you, no calendar needed just look outside. Are the eggs laid? Are the goslings following the Goose? Are the baby bunnies hopping around? Are the kits beside the Vixen and Reynard? Do the Spring flowers pierce the once frozen ground? Do the buds and blossoms coat the limbs of the orchard tree? Even with a light dusting of snow one can see the gift of new life abound. The hope and possibilities of the time before us! This is why I say Happy Eastertide instead of Easter. It depends on where you live and yearly weather patterns. Last year Easter did not arrive until nearly June, the year before the Church's choice was surprisingly spot on. But that is where I live, further North it may be months behind and further south it may have arrived much earlier. But regardless the season of Easter or ""Eastertide"" is in play you can feel in it in the air just as you can Halloween or Yuletide. A Glad Eastertide To All!

With his famous Catchphrase ""I Am Groot!"" But I may be getting ahead of myself; what is a Spriggan? They are a type of Gaelic Fae well regarded for their loyal and protective natures. They are often plant like with twisted limbs and childish heads. Sometimes small as a flower other times swelling to enormous proportions when protecting that which they hold most dear. Spriggan are the bodyguards and defenders of Fae as well as locations or beings to which they grow attached. They are playful and mischievous known for befriending small creatures which live in and on their herbaceous form; guarding standing stones, burial mounds, homes and newborns as well as many Fae Folk. Not known for their conversation Spriggans have a rather limited vocabulary. Some say they are young giants, others elderly giants, others still say ghosts of giants. Most are sure they tie into trolls but never how. Spriggan are known to freeze in place when untrustworthy folk are near, hiding as plant or hillock. They can also be deadly, known for their disproportionate strength and Wyrd strain of Luck where a bloody war could be happening all around, yet escape unscathed dancing joyously all the while. If that sounds familiar it should, He is Groot! Which is especially fitting as Groot is the defender of the Guardians of the Galaxy all of whom are canonically depicted with Faelike appearances and abilities. Media does not arise from nothing, it is part of a well of lore that reaches back to a time forgot. When used it often draws great joy from our people. Thus In modern media it is important to not only be able to recognize creatures from our folklore and spirituality. It is equally important that once they have been identified to protect them, cherish them. For our spirits are as precious and real to us as angels are to Christians. It falls to us to safeguard their stories.

Over the the last year though I have become more and more ardent in my belief in the fact that America is not a single nation but many. Pretending we are is killing us. It decays the local cultures, disregards the needs of the local community in favor of some amorphous concept of the national benefit. As if the West Coast cares what the East Coast needs, or the Great Lakes concern themselves with the Gulf. The reliance of different regions on the others for resources erodes the local identity and the inability to tell another group to go fuck themselves causes increased animosity to the point that millions pray every year for California to sink into the sea or New York City to Burn to the Ground, though those are just the most famous of what is an increasing sea of bad blood across the Union. Where once the accomplishments of ones region, state or town would've been a means for pride. Increasingly these are treated as meaningless as the overall identity has faded. With it not simply being state vs state, but states themselves are made up of several ""Nations"" that are tearing themselves asunder. For America at its founding was several nations, each with its own cultures and beliefs. One was Virginian before one was American. Each state was part of the Union by choice, each one had consented to be part of something for the benefits such cooperation could create. In truth the United States was a Confederation of Nations and Tribes not unlike the Franks of Europe or the Sioux of the Plains. To protect our local cultures, our identity we must divorce. If not as a Confederation, or a Union, as an idea of a single Nation. The Mountainfolk of Appalachia and the Forestmen of Cascadia are not the same. I don't have any interest in destroying our cultures that descend and flourish from our ancestors in favor of some false conception of a singular nation.",2023-03-26 20:35:42+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/3251,,,860,0,22,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the nature of Lobsters though there are incredibly important rules and traditions followed. These require an understanding of the Lobsters life cycle, habits and behavior on a deep level to be able to properly trap for Lobsters. Unlike other fishing industries, Lobster Fishing has remained largely small scale and family oriented with the various fisherman enforcing their own code of conduct such as limiting the number of Lobsters one can take or as seen in the above video marking breeding females to be unable to be kept. Lobsters can live over a hundred years being effectively immortal, only dying when they become too big to molt. As such a properly tended environment and population of Lobsters can feed people indefinitely but it requires understanding, genuine care and respect for these delicious buttery crustaceans.",2023-03-20 13:56:30+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/3220,,,589,0,9,1,PeerChannel,1480025478.0,GeeDunkNautica,2023-03-20 04:49:58,2023-03-20,https://t.me/GeeDunkNautica/1034,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,video/mp4,4.954164429982795e+18,47.0,Lobster wide.mp4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Honey War was a territorial dispute that almost erupted into a full blown war between Iowa and Missouri in the mid 1800's. It More or less began in 1816 when a land survey decided Iowa's southern border was at ""The Rapids of the River Des Moines"" but the problem was, Which Rapids?. Things only got more ridiculous from there with the governors of each territory becoming more and more hostile with each other. With part of Van Buren County in Iowa being effectively annexed by Missouri. The matter continued to escalate when Missouri Tax Collectors or in some stories impatient Missourians cut down a bunch of ""Bee Trees"" in the same area which gave the war its name. It stopped just short of erupting into full scale conflict due to the intervention of The Supreme Court who decided in Iowa's Favor in 1849 (Some say 1951 or at least that was when the decision was accepted) though it may have also been averted because when men went with whiskey, torches, pitchforks and shotguns. The Night was what can only be described as Fekkin' Cold! Many deserted as a result. One of the many conflicts between different states over borders or other things. As the States were once allowed to war with each other to solve their own issues. This was due to each state effectively being it's own country as opposed to post Civil War when the USA became a more or less singular country. Which one could argue just allows a bigger mess as each state fights the other with bureaucracy and Bullsh*ting.

There lie many fighting men, Dead in their youthful prime, Never to laugh nor love again Or taste of the summer time; For death came flying through the air And stopped his flight at the dugout stair, Touched his prey - And left them there - Clay to clay. He hid their bodies stealthily In the soil of the land they sought to free, And fled away. Now over the grave abrupt and clear Three volleys ring; And perhaps their brave young spirits hear The bugle sing: “Go to sleep! Go to sleep! Slumber well where the shell screamed and fell. Let your rifles rest on the muddy floor, You will not need them any more. Danger’s past; Now at last, Go to sleep!” There is on earth no worthier grave To hold the bodies of the brave Than this place of pain and pride Where they nobly fought and nobly died. Never fear but in the skies Saints and angels stand Smiling with their holy eyes On this new-come band. St. Michael’s sword darts through the air And touches the aureole on his hair As he sees them stand saluting there, His stalwart sons; And Patrick, Brigid, Columkill Rejoice that in veins of warriors still The Gael’s blood runs. And up to Heaven’s doorway floats, From the wood called Rouge Bouquet A delicate cloud of bugle notes That softly say: “Farewell! Farewell! Comrades true, born anew, peace to you! Your souls shall be where the heroes are And your memory shine like the morning-star. Brave and dear, Shield us here.

The woman was identified as Hallie Latham Illingworth, a waitress and resident of Port Angeles. Hallie had been reported missing 3 years prior to her body being discovered. Miraculously, her body had been well preserved by the minerals in the lake interacting with her body fat, resulting in her flesh becoming a soap-like consistency, able to be ""scooped like putty."" This is a process called 'Saponification' The near freezing temperatures of the water also helped the corpse remain intact. Hallie's body showed signs of blunt force trauma and strangulation. Investigators focused in on her husband. Montgomery ""Monty"" Illingworth. Monty was known for his temper and jealousy. Hallie's coworkers revealed that she had often come into work with bruises. One day Hallie didn't show for a shift. When questioned by her boss, Monty said she had runaway with an Alaskan Sailor. When the body was discovered, Monty insisted it was not Hallie's body, but a dental hygienist confirmed that the dental plate within Hallie's mouth, was one he had constructed for her specifically. The condemning evidence against Monty, was the rope used in the crime. A shopkeeper came forward with what he said were the remnants of that rope, which Monty had borrowed 3 years prior. The fibers matched. Monty was sentenced to life in prison, but severed only 9 years, before being paroled. He lived out the rest of his life in California, and died in 1974. Ever since Monty was released, Hallie's ghost has been seen at night, glowing in the darkness, a white figure drifting along the surface of the cold waters of Lake Crescent.",2023-03-18 04:39:24+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/3206,,,568,0,3,1,PeerChannel,1708539788.0,storytellingtradition,2023-03-18 04:38:05,2023-03-18,https://t.me/storytellingtradition/680,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hanging on the side of a house or barn these large square examples of Folk Art have a rich history stretching back to before the founding of the country. Similar in appearance to the Pennsylvania Dutch Hex Sign the Barn Quilt is less specific to an individual group and is practiced in Rural areas from the East Coast through to the Southwest. Though they are most well known from the Midwest where certain areas have a painted Quilt Square on pretty much every barn if not multiples. A Barn Quilt is rather simple in idea but immensely varied in design. As the Barn Quilt can be any pattern or shape but is most often painted with Quilt patterns and designs. Such as Corn and Beans, Jacob’s ladder, Compass Star and Carpenter’s Wheel, among many others. Many are based off patterns that have been passed down in family lines making the Barn Quilts a form of familial Heraldry. Other Barn Quilts will use regional, local or even historic patterns to paint their Barn Quilts. Many of the Barn Quilts are painted in honor of historic moments and even in memory of a loved one. Despite the iconic Folk Paintings they are today, the oldest Barn Quilts are thought to be pictures sewn into Quilts and Hung on the Side as a way to communicate who lived there or even occupation. They have since exploded in popularity since the turn of the millennia and become a popular tourist attraction with several Barn Quilt Trails popping up. (Some people who will not be named because I don't agree with disparaging the differently abled think they invented it in 2000) Do You Know of Any Barn Quilts?

What's more, the Hoop Snake has a poisonous stinger at the end of its tail, and if while in the pursuit of its prey, it should get caught in a tree, that will be the end of it. This seemed to be a fairly common occurrence, as it was suggested that if you found yourself in the path of this predator you should take your safety in a tree. The impact would unloop the snake, the stinger would become stuck, as this unusual creature cannot pull its stinger frontwards, it would starve. In these cases, the tree would become the victim.

Barrie for his 1904 play Peter Pan and later novelization in Peter and Wendy. Most people have based their understanding of Faerie off this character and that is perfectly understandable as people learn from stories and when combined with ""Seeing is believing"" well quite frankly this is a powerful spell cast upon the innocent Hyperborean mind. While she is NOT Faerie she is quite obviously Fae. So if she is not a Faerie or a Pixie what is she? Tinkerbell is what would be known as a sprite! A tiny glimmering light of hope and innocence that is as malevolent as she is gentle. Sprites are tiny creatures often winged but not always and are known to perform such wonderous tasks as the setting of dewdrops upon the flowers in the morning sun or guiding pollen to the flowers so that they might reproduce. Sprites on occasion ride upon the rays of light that cast through the canopy or even the sparks of the evening flame. While Tinkerbell might be fictional in and of herself this does not mean we cannot love her, appreciating her character and imagery, her heroism however small and overlooked. To safeguard not only her but our long and varied customs, we must first recognize her for what she is regardless of any misnaming by her various creators. She is a Sprite! A cute, adorable, mischievous little Sprite! Is that not enough? What more must she be? Is such a thing as a Sprite too small for you? Or is she... perhaps... the perfect size?

It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.”-Socrates One of the most common, complex and important questions that we get asked regularly is ""What Martial Art if any should one seek to learn?"" The reality is there is no singular style that is best and it is often situational. This is why Hyperborean Martial arts such as Catch, Boxing and Wrestling often incorporate many differing styles into their training. But while these function well for Hand-to-Hand combat Hyperborean's also have a long history of armed martial arts. Not least of which is the use of firearms. The capability to use one expertly was once a mark of adulthood. So the real question is ""Which martial art fits most into the modern world and has the greatest probability of being useful in the most situations both real and imagined?"" To that we suggest taking up the sport of 3 Gun, though potentially cost prohibitive for some it provides the most well rounded skill set for the modern world and is usable both on and off the modern battlefield... and lets face it ""It's just fun to make guns go brrrr!"". - 3-Gun Style is a sport that involves proceeding along timed courses using 3 Guns: Rifle, Shotgun and Handgun while shooting certain targets and NOT SHOOTING others. These obstacle courses are often reminiscent of Zombie-Apocalypses, Old West Shootouts and other common adventurous scenarios. It is probably one of the best ways to train oneself physically, mentally or strategically for the modern world. Even if one never needs to use it off the course and firing range.

msg_iteration.3002.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.3059,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,3059,,"What if I told you we still wear Traditional European Dress? The most common style of dress one may see in modern America is a combination of shoes Sneakers/Boots work pants Jeans/Cargo Pants A light shirt T-Shirt a light jacket Flannels etc. a hoodie and maybe a hat. This style has remained more or less unchanged since the 1990's. Many will decry this as a degradation of style or a symptom of the downfall of civilization! But that is far from the truth. Without strict social demands as to what one can and can't wear we simply return to our own nature and as such anything we wear must serve some kind of pragmatic purpose. As such with what we have at our disposal we rebuilt a traditional European Dress using modern garments. The hoodie is the modern cloak, work pants a form of light armor akin to the past, shoes are hobnail boots, the two layers of shirts are a continuation of older layered garb. This returning to pragmatism and making what can be termed a ""Modern Traditional Dress"" has sent the Fashion Industry into a panic! As after dragging around the zeitgeist by its nostrils for the last thousand years people finally realized that the same industry whose passion is making dresses for men and suits for women is more a symptom of mental illness than anything they'd like to represent. What is missing that we can all sense from this modern dress is in fact Quality. If we truly wish to return to a form of clothing that is less controlled by large industry and better for us as a people than my suggestion is to take what works for people and simply return to traditional materials and tailoring methods. After all what are logos and graphic prints if not a replacement for folk patterns and embroidery? With our peoples natural builds, fabrics and symbols taken into account this common clothing would be a natural continuation of any traditional garb of Europe.

msg_iteration.3040.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.3021,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,3021,,"Nine Common English Words With Pagan Meanings Weird: This is still used correctly even if we don't realize it. Previously Spelled Wyrd as in the Web of Wyrd or the God Wyrd it means the unexplainable, the unexpected, the odd, the strange, the lucky combined! Modern remainders of this ancient meaning include The Weird Sisters and Weirding Women. Isn't that Weird? Example: ""Christ is Mighty, but Wyrd is Mightier""-Old English Saying Oz: If you hear the word Oz you might think of a nickname for Oswald or Osbourne, perhaps even The Wizard of Oz! But Oz is actually a very old word. It's meaning? God or Godlike! Which might explain why most people with Oz as a name are A LOT. This is also the name and pictographic meaning of the English ""O Rune"". Thus The Land of Oz is the Realm of the Gods! Example: Norman Osbourne = Northman Bear-God Robin: Robin is a given name but it is actually much more. Robin was used as a code or byname for a god or powerful spirit by British Witch Cults. We still see this today in Robin Hood (Robin Wode) even the bird known as Robin Redbreast is often associated with storm gods and is a favored form of orchard spirit. The church instead translated Robin to mean Devil. Example: Robin Goodfellow = God of the Pagans Jack: Jack is a name for a ""Spirit"" such as Jack Frost (Spirit of Frost), Jack of the Green (Spirit of the Green), Jack O'Lantern (Spirit of the Lantern) similar to Robin it was used in Engaland to refer to both gods and godlike beings. It also was used to reference certain ghosts such as Jack-in-Irons or trickster figures like Jack the Giant Killer. Example: Jack Flash=The Devil (Possibly Spirit or God of Fire/Light/Surprise Originally?) Ghost: While currently meaning the disembodied soul of the dead Ghost actually has a much broader meaning encompassing not only human souls but nature spirits, spectral beings and even gods. This is in contrast to spirit which actually means ""Divine Breath"". This makes sense as the line between a soul of man and a household or forest god is extremely loose or even nonexistent. Example: The Ghost of Christmas Present Genius: Geniuses or Genii (Not to be confused with Djinn) are Roman tutelary gods and the divine masculine spark present in men as well as places and things. When we call a man a Genius we are calling him a god incarnate. The Cult of the Emperors in Rome actually venerated The Genius of the Emperor. Example: Genius of Julius Caesar Hour: Descended of The Greek Female Gods known as The Hours or The Horae being gods of the seasons. Every Hour is thus a season unto itself and thus has its own god associated with it. Example: God Carpo the Hour of Harvest (Season) Mad: An extreme ecstatic or emotional state. Whether anger, joy, sorrow, seen in figures such as The Mad Hatter, Mad Max or The Mad Irishman Stephen in the Film Braveheart. There are also several gods known to be mad such as Robin Wode (Another name for Robin Hood), Woden (The Mad God) and The Corn Giant Wode (The Mad). The emotional state of rapture could also be considered a specific type of madness. Those who were ""Mad"" were sometimes considered touched by the gods or simply ""Touched"". Example: ""The Almighty tells me he can get me out of this mess, but he's pretty sure you're fucked!"" Stephan the Mad, Braveheart Stem: To Stem From, we use it with the same connotations to this day. Though more often in association with plants then other uses. However! Stem also has a rather obscure meaning as it is another word for Tribe! (Tribe is actually derived specfically from the three founding groups of Rome thus the ""Tri"" part) This is most clearly seen in the German Stem Duchy (or Stämme including Franconia, Bavaria, Saxony, Etc) as well as in a German name for ""Family Tree"" Stammbaum. Thus each tribe stems from the larger tree of our peoples! Example: ""Well we live in the Midwest now but our family line stems from the Alps!""

Especially those whom are their distant kin known as Hyperboreans. There is a love there. A love coupled with the love of games which their divine cousins do so seem to enjoy... Yet the Fae have never been all that good at understanding us. Mortals are the eternal puzzle that they have yet to solve, however hard they try. Harlequin beguiled by human morals and concepts, while Puck is enamored with human Imagination. But regardless they love to play with us hoping against hope that we will love them in return. Such is the hope of Harlequin throughout many stories old and new. One recent example is that of Labyrinth (1986) a film that features ""The Goblin King"" an epithet and role of Harlequin, played by David Bowie who is a dead ringer for him from his flamboyant outfits to his Goblin and Pooka subjects. In it, enamored as he is with the young Sarah he decides to give her her wildest dreams. Giving her everything she wanted. Her brother gone, a grand adventure with hardships untold and perils unnumbered. The Least She Could Do Is Say Thank You! Or something... anything... ""You cowered before me! I WAS frightening."" But instead she has to go and end the game. For all the quirks of the Faerie they are sticklers for rules and the game Harlequin chose to play was full of them. In a twist of irony the film ends with Harlequin the only Fae involved in the game to not end up beloved by Sarah. Such is the irony of the fate of The Faerie. They try so hard to be all we desire, but in doing so their lack of understanding makes their grand gestures often more harrowing than endearing.

Settled in 1869 by Swiss Immigrants mostly artisans. Helvetia is a little taste of Alpine culture in Appalachia. The area like most had their German heritage downplayed in WW2 but has persevered regardless. Named after the Helvetii Celtic Tribes that settled in the Swiss Alps the area continues the culinary, linguistic, and artistic traditions of Switzerland. Especially notable is their celebration of Fasnacht (Swiss Carnival) which is combined with another Swiss Pagan rite of Spring Sechseläuten which burns the Böögg an effigy of Winter. In Helvetia the Böögg has been replaced with Old Man Winter but Green Men, Animal and Plant Spirits as well as ghosts and various traditional costumes such as Mountaineers predominate. Other elements of Appalachian Culture have bled into Helvetia including Appalachian folk music and Square Dancing. When Old Man Winter is burnt one is likely to hear Country Roads Take Me Home rather than a traditional Swiss song. The culture may be rich and the Cell Service may be nonexistent but Helvetia's population has sadly fallen to 59 and like many similar towns that preserved and perpetuated traditions in the USA such as the Amana Colonies in Iowa the town is dying.

msg_iteration.3092.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.2967,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,2967,,"The Great White Moose of Maine In 1891, sightings of a spectral white moose were reported in Maine. A hunter in Bangor, was the first to come forward. The man claimed that this was no ordinary moose. Aside from it being the most luminescent white, he said the creature stood at 13 feet tall and its antlers had to have been 10 feet across. The hunter fired several shots at the magnificent specter, but it was as though the bullets just bounced right off. After this, he figured it best to run on home. The moose was seen again in 1899. This time the witness, a boy on a bicycle, stated that it charged at him, resulting in the abandonment of his transport as he frantically climbed up a tree to safety. He said that after inspecting the bicycle, the animal disappeared into the forest. A few more people came forward with their own stories well into the 20th century. In the 1950s, a group of hunters killed a giant white moose, cut its throat and strang it up to skin the next day. When morning came, they were baffled to find that their kill had vanished! If that wasn't enough to rattle their teeth, when the moose reappeared that night, bloody throat and all, the hunters believe they had to be mad. They shot the moose dead...again, but only a couple minutes later, the thing got back up and slowly walked away. They decided to just accept their losses. The stories of this great white moose don't all end with the witnesses shook up. One man who lost is way in the forest, was rescued by the animal. He said the moose scooped him up in its antlers and carried him back to town.",2023-02-08 04:57:15+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/2967,,,604,0,11,1,PeerChannel,1708539788.0,storytellingtradition,2023-01-31 08:35:16,2023-01-31,https://t.me/storytellingtradition/666,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a sort of primeval land this final frontier of the contiguous United States was a fabled land for both Americans further East and for settlers coming from Europe to start a new life. Alongside the Gold Rush the most important industry in the area was the logging industry. Given the Fairy Tale and Mythic quality of the size of the trees it was natural that not only would it take months and months to cut them but that they would leave a rather impressive stump. Not ones to let things go to waste the Settlers took to the stumps turning them into hotels, dancefloors, Post Offices, barns and yes Houses! With some being as small as a studio apartment while others were three stories tall! These fantastical Stump Houses are effectively the traditional houses of the Western Coastal States and they existed up into the 1990's as Roadside attractions and Local Landmarks such as the famous stump house in Eureka, California. Sadly many if not all have since rotted away. Though one can imagine the sight of neighborhoods built in the middle of the Forest with dance floors atop amber sealed stumps and homes fit for a Keebler Elf or Forest Faerie.",2023-02-04 22:23:27+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/2934,,,2135,0,71,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within each of us lies the divine spark that can be nurtured to shine like the Northern Stars in all their splendid majesty. But this potential must be stoked, it must go through trials and tribulations. It must be tested and pushed to its limits so that it might truly flourish. This can take many forms: Fighting, Crafting, Sailing, or in this case Music. When a Bard strikes that Sacred Chord it is no longer the keys of the piano or the strings of the guitar being played but those of the soul itself. Untouchable, unrefined, unpolished, unrestrained but nothing less than the perfect thing at the perfect time. A form of ancient magic that is indescribable but unmistakable. It CANNOT be manufactured! Such magic is the gift that is being fostered by this Young Man from West Virginia Jake Kohn, with naught but a cellphone and a guitar he sings with a voice that the most ancient of bards would weep joyful tears over taking him under their wing to become one of the greatest of their number. If he continues to nurture this divine nature he will enter the Lore of our people as a legend in his own right in that pantheon of bards who strike the strings of the soul and the harmonies of the gods themselves. But like any gift it is all in how it is used and how it is nurtured, it is always possible for a gift to be fettered away. Only time will tell how this exact divine spark will play out. Will it burn as bright as the northern dawn or turn to ashes in the years to come?

Or as his original name reads Heikki Lunta? Well technically that is his original name, he has many variations in his name in local Yooper lore such as Snow, Mr. Snow, King Snow, etc. He may have even descended from a Finnish Snow God from the Old Country such as the one often translated as ""Jack Frost"" in the Kalevala. Not out of the question as Finnish Americans are most concentrated among the Michigan Yooper culture and kept many of their old pagan traditions from Finland. However Hank Snow has become one of the most well known figures of Yooper Myth and Legend even having the largest Yooper Winter Festival Heikinpäivä in Hancock, Michigan. He is often depicted with a bushy beard and snow goggles with a winter cap and a flannel. Though he is also depicted as a pile of living winter fur coats. This Heikki festival involves the Three Heikki's the aforementioned Snow God, A Finnish ""Saint"" known as St. Henrik and a local Grand Marshall of the festival known as Hankookin Heikki. Heikki's legend became most pronounced after his supposed origin in 1970 when David Riutta a local DJ wrote the song ""Heikki Lunta’s Snow Dance"" which supposedly caused snow to fall. When the snow is too prolific another song by Riutta is played ""Heikki Lunta Go Away"". The former of the two songs supposedly gained fame for delivering snow to the Range Snowmobile Club's Snowmobile Race when snow failed to fall. Heikki Lunta is said to be married to his childhood sweetheart Aino Mäkinen and has a large extended family including a son Heikki Jr.",2023-01-29 03:02:28+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/2900,,,655,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Those who practice it are called ""Powwowers"" or ""Powwow Doctors"" or ""Braucher"" --------------------------------------------------------------- After several years of misfortune and a variety of illness, John Blymire became convinced that he had been cursed. He went to the River Witch, Nellie Noll for her help. After all, Nellie had cured him of measles as a baby. After several sessions, each costing him $5 dollars apiece, Nellie revealed that the person responsible just so happened to be John's neighbor; Powwow Doctor, Nelson Rehmeyer. John couldn't deny the cold that kept up his spine when he heard the name. Everyone in York County knew who Nelson Rehmeyer. Most steered clear of him if they had common sense. Something wasn't right about that man. Even his wife refused to stay in their home, as she described her husband as being ""too damned peculiar."" Nellie explained to him that the Hex was too strong for her to lift. She told John that he must do it himself. In order to do this, he must burn Nelson's book of charms and bury a lock of his hair. Now, this book of his is actually a well known to the Pennsylvania Dutch. It was written by John George Hohman in 1870. The title: The Long Lost Friend. Within it, the reader will discover old German folk magic, herbal remedies, among other things. (Side Note: the Pennsylvania Dutch are of German descent, not Dutch, I guess people were confused back then, but I haven't really looked into it). Fueled by desperation and rage, John entered Nelson's home with 2 other men. They beat Nelson, and tied him to a chair, then interrogated him on the location of this book. When it became clear that Nelson wouldn't budge, John drenched him in kerosene and set him on fire. At his trial, John Blymire claims that even though the flames engulfed the body, it did not burn. Nelson Rehmeyer's house still stands. The area, origin Rehmeyer's Hollow, has been commonly referred to as Hex Hollow ever since Nelson's death. There are many stories involving the paranormal associated with the property. Some claim to see a black dog with red or green eyes, looking down from the branches of the tree under which, Nelson was buried. Teenagers have created a tradition of throwing rocks at the house, only to have the rocks hurtled right back at them.",2023-01-21 16:34:07+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/2874,,,597,0,3,1,PeerChannel,1708539788.0,storytellingtradition,2023-01-20 20:43:53,2023-01-20,https://t.me/storytellingtradition/661,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among such things is one of the most prolific and widespread deities of Europe and you never even knew he was there. Who is He? He has been called many things. Some call him The Grand Actor, others name him The Dark Assassin or The Great Jester. You may even know him as The Goblin King, his most prolific name however is The Harlequin. Though in recent years one more infamous epithet of his has become a household name... The Joker. He is The Divine Fool, The Jester of the Faerie Court and a most powerful Fae King. He is the oldest friend of Puck sharing with him his fascination of Mankind and his penchant for using reality as a plaything. But the playmates of The Harlequin are not children. It is with far more lethal individuals that the Harlequin chooses to play his games. He has many followers, at first glance they may appear to be quite mad. It is far worse than that, his followers are in fact incredibly sane. The Harlequin does not understand these things mortals treasure; Justice, Duty, Honor, Nobility. These immutable yet intangible things. To understand them The Harlequin has his games, his mummers farces. Elaborate flamboyant plots and contrivances. These games are often fatal though not always, for more than anything else he is puzzled and infatuated with Death and how it ties into these things. The Harlequin does his best to understand, he slays the thief of a cup and slaps the wrist of a murderer unable to understand with his most convincing of performances why these are not just or fair or noble. What strange fools these mortals be. For such riveting endless macabre performances The Harlequin became the idol of Actors, Assassins and Highwaymen alike. This stage wherein the tender strings of reality are played. He has become the God of Théâtre! His visage once shaggy, horned the wildest of Witch Gods, soon became draped in pied patterns of finery. His black mask replaced with elegant patterns. He became embodied in The Court Jester, The Mime, Pulcinella, Pierrot, Arlecchino, Punch and even the humble Clown. His visage spread with his craft across the realm on the front of Playing cards, the circus clowns reigning in charging elephants defying death with a manic cackle, they prance at the edge of Carnival, his followers juggle and play for the whole world is their stage! In due time even when the Wild Faerie King became shrouded in old tomes and passing fancies he was reborn in a figure quite well known to us still playing his games, still pondering the riddle of Man. And in this performance a man known as Heath Ledger embodied him so much that he suffered a fate not unknown to those who have come to know Harlequin... he died. To Harlequin and his games, life is nothing but a comedy and standing smiling and confounded as much today as he was the first time he saw us, he marvels at our madness and our supposed rules with contented wonder...

Or Even ""Pagan"" Gods? Let Me Explain... What we call ""Pagan"" is merely a term used to refer to the Instinctive Ethnic Ways innate to OUR people. To the point that it was not uncommon to call unbaptized children ""Little Pagans"". The term however has become corrupted into a dichotomy of Abrahamic Vs. Non-Abrahamic. History, Ancestry and even Symbols the entirety of a peoples inheritance is split, uprooted and taken from them. This is such a strong split that it is not uncommon for peoples to consider their Genesis as a Tribe or Nation to be within the last 1500 or even 1000 years. This has caused a disconnect present throughout entire cultures wherein it is not uncommon to find people cheering the conquest of their own people by the church; because those ""Pagans"" weren't them, even if their blood, their ancestry and history is entirely tied up with them. It is to the Church that most end up tracing their history from their peoples conquest to Christianity's Judeo-Roman origins and then before Yeshua tied into the Old Testament. This severs most from their history, their ancestry, the entirety of their inheritance stretching back through the ages. The ""Pagan Gods"" are not pagan gods, They are OUR gods! Jurate, Brigid, Thor, Heracles, Dajbog, Väinämöinen etc. Not only that by OUR lore these gods ARE our ancestors both in flesh and in soul. These symbols and stories are OURS they are not pagan. Nor are they lost as some supposedly foolish religion before the coming of the Church, they are a part of us. Our INHERITANCE! The longer we continue to allow the false schism to persist the further we will be torn from our own peoples Neverending Story. An attack on OUR gods is an attack on US, an attack on ""Our Ethnic Ways"" is an attack on OUR cultures and the peoples. Your Forebears weren't Pagans They Were Your Forebears.

If one does a quick glance around the interwebs they will see claims it originated as a Christian Song specifically in Ameriblack Circles. Or that it started life as ""When the Chariot Comes"" that it was a reference to The Underground Railroad and later used for Mother Jones a Labor Activist... This is all complete and utter Sh*t. The Song is actually about what else, a prostitute. It was sung by workmen specifically miners and the like who would often look forward to the arrival of or traveling to ""Entertainers"" specifically of the female variety. Though in the modern day this may seem crude the reality is it was not uncommon outside of the heavily Puritanical areas of the United States Prostitutes' were common and might even have status. Folklore is replete with them such as the magical Brothels of Paul Bunyan Lore or the beloved Mate of Doc Holliday Big Nose Kate or even Pecos Bill's true love Slue Foot Sue. Like most of these elements of American Folklore repeated attempts have been made to clean up the Song rebranding it, changing history in order to fit the false idea of a heavily Christian and prudish nation (Prudish Nations Don't Make Cowboys). The Song despite being considered a Children's Folk Song is more of a Workmen's song expressing their excitement for the prostitutes and the lyrics are all thinly veiled references to the acts and joys the men would associate with these women. The Six White Horses are the Men Lining up to be ""Ridden"" while many of the other lyrics change too often and have been altered deliberately to reveal the songs original meaning.

What truly is a resolution? - Definition: Resolution /ˌrezəˈlo͞oSH(ə)n/ 1. a firm decision to do or not to do something. ""she kept her resolution not to see Anne any more"" 2.the quality of being determined or resolute. ""he handled the last French actions of the war with resolution"" Synonym: intention, resolve, decision, intent, aim, aspiration, design, purpose, plan, commitment, pledge, promise. - You might notice a word missing from this list of official synonyms, this word being OATH. This is by design, I have come to have no doubt of; as all peoples understand the inherent nature of an oath. The taking of resolutions being relegated to but a childs game, a lightheated oath made in fancy and glee during the excitement of the moment. All in an effort to make us 'Oath Breakers'. -Be Forewarned- Oaths are not to be made frivolously, while one may ask to be released from previous oaths by the the gods or man this can be done only ONCE, for one should know better after a single transgression. Take care to complete the oaths you take upon yourself even in flights of fancy, for they will hang over your head until they are fulfilled weighing upon you forevermore should you fail to deliver upon your word.

Many larger projects ended up on backburner as we focused on maintaining a regular schedule and balancing it with the humdrum happenings of day-to-day life. YET TOGETHER we were still able to post over a thousand posts this year several articles and record the second half of season 3 and the first 27 episodes of Season 4 of Hyperborean Radio (Uncensored). We also had several series of posts this year including long form series such as Animal Lore and Cults of Hyperborea series. With you we more than doubled both Our Telegram Following and Our Website Traffic! We were even able to add another Remythed Grimm Tale to our future book in the form of Sleeping Beauty, The Myth of Easter Due to your support we have even been able to put Heathen Artist Neale Rundgren on retainer as a Regular Artist and Graphic Designer for our various ongoing works. We have a lot planned for the coming Year, but will keep those cards close to the vest until they're ready to be played. Best Wishes in the New Year. Sincerely, Celtic God and The Lore Keeper The 10 Most Popular Articles From Our Archives in 2022 1- The Origins of Santa Claus 2- Hertha, The Germanic Mother Earth? 3- The Ironwood and the Wolf Spirits 4- Tales of the Frauen: Holle, Frikka, Perchta, Harke, Gaude and More 5- Easter, The Goddesses of New Life 6- Witches, What Really Were the Witch Cults? 7- Wolves in European Spirituality 8- A Brief Discussion of the Gods 9- King Groundhog, The Origins of Groundhog Day 10- Freya, The Mother of Sweden - Thank You to All Our Supporters and to Those That Share Us and Thank You Especially To Our Friends Who Have been Tremendous Help and Company in this Last Year.

Part of this may have to do with many birds not going South for the Winter and actually nesting in the woods and nearby human settlements. They would congregate in the old sacred groves where Yuletide and Christmas celebrations would be celebrated with a big bonfire (Yule Log). The birds attracted to the warmth and shimmering ornaments in the trees would be a common sight of Yuletide. In America that has carried over Robins, Sparrows and many other birds remain symbols of the season. But perhaps the most popular by far is the beloved Cardinal one of the most well received and treasured bird of the continent. With its blood red plumage, sweet song and striking Mohawk the Cardinal has become a Cultural Mainstay near the level of the Turkey and Bald Eagle. But it has something the other two do not, The Cardinal is the De facto most popular bird of the Yuletide in North America. Appearing in Folk Art, Christmas Ornaments and even Yuletide Embroidery. This tradition of the Ancestors visiting along with the birds continues to this day. Welcome them leave them some food and a place to call home this Yuletide. If nothing else their Birdsong is a welcome addition to the Yuletide Carols. 🌲🔥🎄 Good Yuletide and Merry Christmas (Krismas) Folks!",2022-12-24 20:31:31+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/2707,,,677,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Starting the Holy Day off with some friendly competition. The Pickle likely originated from Michigander-Germans. It was once thought to have originally come from Germany but apparently the tradition was unheard of in the Old Country. The exact origin of the Christmas Pickle is unknown but the tale of it being an Old German Custom was likely started as a way to sell Glass Pickle Ornaments to Americans Eager to connect to their roots in the 1800's. Though it is also possible it started becoming an American-German Tradition and simply was thought to have originated in the Old Country rather than being an American original as there were once several Christmas Pickle Festivals such as the one in Berrien Springs, MI.",2022-12-24 19:07:15+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/2705,,,644,0,14,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.3385.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.2667,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,2667,,"""Thomas Nast was born in Bavaria though he spent most of his early life in America having emigrated there in the 1840’s. Nast is famous for being one of the progenitors of the current Santa Claus image and while his view was likely colored partly by his families Bavarian heritage the Santa Claus he would end up depicting was unapologetically American. He had to be, for Nast was not a painter or an illustrator by trade, he was a political cartoonist. His earliest depictions of Santa Claus for Harper’s Magazine paint Santa Claus as not only a firmly American figure but also firmly Union, as Nast was a staunch Republican and during the Civil War his depictions of Santa Claus began to appear on a regular basis. The first such one may mark the original depiction of Nast’s Santa and he is neither decked out in furs nor in red, but in the Stars and Stripes. Nast’s first depiction of Santa in his Stars and Stripes was printed in 1863, forty years after the anonymous publishing of ’twas the Night Before Christmas. Yet aside from the prominent belly and what appears to be white tailed deer not much has been retained from one figure to the other. It is unclear how much of Santa’s coming down the chimney existed before the famous poem but it is more than likely it predates it and instead merely popularized it. The same can be said of his deer, while the number and name of the deer can both be credited to the poem, Santa Claus having a deer cannot, that predates the poem. The famous poem attributed to Moore can also be disregarded as originating most of the customs rather popularizing them or at least the knowledge of them.""- Excerpt of I.M. Knosp's The Origins of Santa Claus. Santa Greets the Union Troops by Thomas Nast The Origins of Santa Claus Article was stellar from Hyperborean Radio, even if one isn't pagan inclined the history and art that they put together is amazing and made me really appreciate the Legend of Santa Claus.

He is all of these and more. Many of us grew up hearing the stories of a Jolly Old Elf riding across the sky and flying down the chimney delivering gifts from his endless sack of toys, children filled with Christmas glee would leave cookies and milk, tobacco and carrots all for this Christmas gift giver. Yet his story is much much more told bit by bit over the centuries his myth as rich as any other. In the genesis of his tale he walked door to door across the snowy landscape, stars in the sky, breath frozen in the raging blizzards. A Yule Log or tree strapped to his back and an ax hanging from his side. He was alone. A Yuletide traveler stopping place to place with gifts, for he was a toy-maker adorned in rich furs and smelling of pipe tobacco. Some children greeted him with joyful smiles others with cries of terror as they would be spirited away never to see their families again while they toiled among his Elves. Other times he held the reins of a horse or stag much like other ghosts of the Parade of Spirits. He was on foot or on hoof and following him were the winds of winter, frost and snow freezing the cobblestone paths and windows he passed.

Or perhaps catch a peek when he came down the chimney? Do you remember that innocent glee that filled you when you by chance saw someone who looked like him around Yuletide? Maybe even running up to them saying ""I've been REALLY good this year Santa!""? You may not have known it but this is one of the oldest of our traditions among Hyperborean Ethnic Ways. The gods look like us and thus those of us that bear a startling resemblance to the Gods bear a duty upon our shoulders. To embody them in everyday life and to do right by the sparkling eyed children who look at us with wonder. Others do so as their career or like the most devoted of Santa's in the USA they do both! Both embodying the god in looks and in personality. From the Red Bearded Chieftains -Thor- of Scandinavian Witch Cults, to the Fur wearing goddess Richella of Italy and beyond through the Alps with Perchten and Krampus to Alibon with Father Christmas amongst the Mummers, we have long embodied the god(s) in both appearance and in deed. Even taking our children to meet them as a rite of passage as we do to this day albeit with a more mercantile Santa Claus, which is why many kids will avoid those but jump up and down in wonder and joy for Old Karl with the belly and big white beard who they meet at the grocer. Santa Claus in that moment is the most real thing in the world! More real than you or me, more important than the presents stuffed under the tree. Magic, the magic of belief. The child might even know it is Karl from the grocer but it doesn't matter as in that moment Karl IS Santa Claus. Every child knows Santa is wherever Santa is needed sliding in and out of reality, looking through the eyes of others but once in awhile... well maybe... just maybe he comes in person.

The largest snapping turtle he had ever seen had broken the surface of the calm waters. Falk and the turtle watched each other closely for several minutes, before the reptilian behemoth, slowly submerged itself again. In his excitement, Falk drove into town and told everyone he encountered, all about what he had seen. He estimated it to have measured 4-5 feet across its shell and weighed 300-500 pounds. He soon realized his mistake, when over the next few days people began trespassing on his land and harassing him, hoping to get their own sighting, or to hunt the creature. Eventually Oscar Falk stopped talking about the encounter all together, and the story was mostly forgotten.... But then in 1950, 135 miles away in Black Oak, a surveyor (Samuel E. Brownsten) and a farmer (Henry ""Potato King"" Ewen) were draining one of four swamps in the area, when the drain became clogged. The men reported that the blockage was caused by a monstrous snapping turtle, ""with a head as big as a human's!"" (Brownsten) Ewen claimed to have tried to aid the animal, "" I pushed on its shell, but man, when I saw the size of that thing, I knew I didn't want to tangle with it. It was as big as a beer barrel.""",2022-12-09 18:10:58+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/2603,,,677,0,2,1,PeerChannel,1708539788.0,storytellingtradition,2022-12-09 18:10:42,2022-12-09,https://t.me/storytellingtradition/642,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His Name…. is Santa Claus. One of the most well known figures of myth around the world, his image is one of the most prolific of any spirit or deity. Velvet coat of crimson red, trimmed in snow white fur, dark boots, large arms and round belly like a bowl full of jelly. His eyes piercing and cheeks rosy, behind him a sack of toys hangs across his broad powerful back. Ash sprinkled across his face staining it rich and black, walking through the flame of the hearth to place gifts beneath the tree and in the stockings of good little boys and girls, while the naughty receive only coal. His sleigh is pulled by nine reindeer, powerfully built and enchanted to fly across the sky with the magic of Christmas. His beloved wife Mrs. Claus doting on her beloved husband. A chest of weapons, an ax at the ready, a tree over his back and a shimmering light emanating from his personage. Ancient eldritch traditions hang from him as naturally as hair or skin. He appears in hand carved idols, small offerings to ancestral spirits, on products and on sacrifices, in film and literature. Yet… who is he? Where did he come from? This Jolly Old Elf. This Bearded Yuletide Wildman. This Nighttime rider. This Old Saint Nick! He was born in the Yuletide.

Yet where did the lovable misanthropic Furry Green Man come from? While the Green color was merely a movie choice with the Grinch originally being black and white the idea of a ""Hairy man"" living on a mountain and being associated with Yuletide is actually an ancient tradition. Wildmen AKA Woodwose are often seen living on Mountains (Rubezahl, Pan, The Orc) and are also associated with the end of the year and the fertile rebirth of the earth. Traditions involving the death of a bear or Wildman only to be symbolically reborn at the end of the mock battle or the next year is older than history. This is often done during the Yuletide. Sometimes the Wildman is a bear, but the Black and White Grinch is even inspired by European Wildman folklore, and when combined with Christmas fulfills an ancient element of the season, with Doctor Seuss even referencing these myths as the inspiration for The Grinch. So remember the next time you watch or read this beloved holiday classic.

Ugh, the snow the clouds I'm so tired, darn seasonal effective disorder - Oh quit you're whining, it's not season defective order the seasons work just fine. We just ain't allowed our wintersleep - Our what now? - *Sigh* I guess I gotta explain this too See most animals in the North are well adapted to changing temperatures, tempestuous climates and Winter. Now there ain't much to do in Winter, seeing as there is snow everywhere and its dark most of the time and the time it ain't could render you blind from the shimmering snow. So what do most animals do? They hunker down for their Wintersleep, or as you might know it they ""Hibernate"". It's not ""True Hibernation"" in the way Frogs and Gators do, most animals in the north sleep when its dark and cold and if it warms up enough they go around a bit collecting food or patching drafts ""Semi-Hibernation"". Then when it cools down they sleep again. We are much the same way, from Siberia to Iberia, America to Tasmania wherever our people go, we would stock up food and firewood and get ready to sleep most of the season away. We'd even prepare much as the animals do, with great feasts to pack on the pounds. In our homes, in our great halls we would take our Wintersleep. Waking for our Holy Days as the wheel turned or if it warmed enough that we may go hunting though at night when the Moon shines upon the snow and the world lights up with an eldritch glow, we'd follow the blood and hoofprints in the snow for a bit of extra meat. There are even memories of this laden across our lands in the tales of The Bear Kings slumber or the Yuletide Myth of the wedding of The Bear and The Maiden Fair. Seen in Snow White & Rose Red as well as the White-Bear-King-Valemon. The Wildman and Woman find each other and go to rest amidst the Yuletide, perhaps arising in the spring with a new generation in arm. Yes, Winter is a time of rest and rejuvenation in contrast to the harsh months of Summer. There is even play the gift of Ullr and Jack Frost for the youngins with too much energy to sleep. They build Idols to Ullr and Jack Frost with carrot noses and button eyes. They play games in their honor, mock war with their snowballs and forts. We even found ways to make traveling more fun with skis and toboggans if anything movement gets a bit easier in Winter, so long as you know what you're doing so long as you don't trounce around all foolish like. Yes, its not Winter's fault we're tired. IN FACT THAT IS HER GIFT. Rather the fault lies at the feet of the world as it is now; that it denies the reality of our people, our nature and our needs, to feed us to their machine. Never resting, never healing. How much closer would families be? How much more energy would we have? How better would the quality of life, the length of life be? If only we were allowed our wintersleep. They even invent disorders, blame the seasons and make artificial summers. Because those in their high towers know, if we slept as we should neath Winters warm blanket. They could not keep things as they are. They could not keep us bound in Gleipneirs reins.-TLK Goldilocks And The Three Bears by Kerry Darlington Are You Rested Enough for Hyperborean Radio (Uncensored)?",2022-11-19 23:25:02+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/2474,,,533,0,5,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2022-11-18 18:09:19,2022-11-18,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/10450,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Boone and his party, were the first frontiersman to settle beyond the borders of the 13 colonies. Today, you can walk through the Daniel Boone National Forest, and take the same paths that Boone, himself cleared. You can even find his initials on some of the trees. A fascinating and wonderful aspect of this land, is that the vast majority of the wilderness has been left untamed and unspoiled...just as Daniel Boone found it.

msg_iteration.3614.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.2433,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,2433,,"On December 31st, 1812, Theodosia Burr boarded the sailing vessel, ""The Patriot' and, was never see again. Daughter of former vice president, Aaron Burr, Theodosia, though struggling with health problems throughout her life, was a highly intelligent and cultured woman. In 1801, she married plantation owner, and later governor of south Carolina, Joseph Alston. They had one child. The boy died of malaria at the age of 10. Stricken with grief, it was immediately after this that Theodosia decided to book passage from South Carolina, to be with her family in New York. Both She and the sailing vessel she boarded would never make it. To this day it is unknown what exactly happened to ""the Patriot"" or Theodosia. There have been various theories over the years. This was during the War of 1812, so some speculated that the Patriot was sunk by enemy ships. Another theory states, that a group of shipwreckers known as the Carolina Bankers were responsible. These men camped out on the edge of Nags Head, a town on the outer banks of North Carolina, and would send out false signals to ships at sea, in order to murder the passengers and crew, and take any goods they might be carrying. What is known is that it disappeared somewhere beween South Carolina and New York, and in 1869 a portrait of what many claim to be Theodosia Burr was uncovered in Nags Head, North Carolina. Part 2 A doctor was called out to a fisherman's cabin, to treat the fisherman's ill wife. When the doctor arrived, he could tell it was only a matter of time until the elderly woman slipped from this earth. He did what he could to ease her pain. The fisherman, though greatful, had little money. Instead, he offered the doctor a fine portrait of a young woman and asked if the doctor would accept this as payment. The doctor was surprised to find such a valuable work of art in the home of a poor fisherman. The doctor asked him how he came by such a thing. The fisherman told him the story of how many years ago, a woman washed up in a rowboat on Nags Head. She had no memory of who she was or where she had come from. The only item she carried with her was this portrait, which she would not allow anyone to take from her. The woman was cared for by the kind people of the town, and she soon became a well loved member of the community. The doctor asked the man what had become of this woman since then, and the man said with a smile, ""She married a silly old fisherman"" Touched by the story, the doctor said he would happily accept the portrait as payment. But when the woman heard this, she sprung up from her bed, screaming ""It is Mine! It is mine! You shall not have it! I am on my way to visit my father in New York, and I am taking this picture of his darling Theodosia!"" The woman snatched the portrait form the doctors grasp and fled out into the night straight into the ocean. She was never seen again, but a week later, the portrait drifted back onto the beach. The painting now hangs in the Lewis Walpole Library in Farmington, Connecticut.",2022-11-15 02:55:20+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/2433,,,551,0,7,1,PeerChannel,1708539788.0,storytellingtradition,2022-01-01 21:07:58,2022-01-01,https://t.me/storytellingtradition/5,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These Indians had come around before in the hopes of stealing the Corliss' cows. John chased them off with his gun. Mary frantically began pacing, trying to figure out what she should do. She was unarmed. Then the thought struck her! Luckily, unlike other homes during that time, the Corliss' had built in a cellar stairway with shelves installed above it, on which they kept the wheels of cheese. Mary went over to the cellar shelves, yelling towards the open window, ""Come on, boys,"" she threw a wheel of cheese down the cellar stairs. ""Go get em,"" another wheel of cheese was thrown. She knew if anyone had seen her, they would think she had gone mad, but she carried on like that for several minutes until the shelves were bare and all the cheese had been thrown down the stairs. She looked out the window. The savages had vanished, thinking all that racket belonged to the footfalls of many men ready to defend the Corliss' home.

So endearing - What do you mean? - Do you not see Why they do so? Well let me help you It's easy to forget what each of us once did for each other. Yet since the time of myth, fire has been the tool of Man. For the Men it was a tool of forestry and forge but for the women it was the hearth flame, the heart of the home. Before matches and lighters, before the flick of a switch could create fire in the blink of an eye. Fire was much harder to control, it was power given form. With simple flame one could build an empire or burn it down in a day. Women have always been attracted to power. Who knows how it began there have always been gods of fire but the one who controls it who holds it in their hand has always been the female. Men wield flame as a weapon... as a tool, Women nurture it. Such has it been since the Long Long Ago, imagine a woman cloaked in only her pride carrying the fire of her people for generations, not the smoldering ashes we see around us today. It's only in recent years fire has lost its purpose, it's light dimmed that The Eternal Flames began to go out. Household after household no longer keeping fires burning. Yet the women still do it you see? They still instictively wish to tend the flames, they have no crones to teach them, they have lost the wisdom of a thousand thousand grandmothers. But the Lore of the Blood is far stronger than mere words. So they continue to amass candles they light them for baths or any old reason. They know it in their bones, their very being that they are the Keepers of the Flame. Long after the Heart of the Home ceased to be the Hearthfire replaced by the soft glow of technology. Yet still memories from beyond the mists of time call to them to guard the flame. One can only hope that one day they will be given the opportunity to keep Their Flames Eternal once more.-TLK By the Hearth (Platt Powell Ryder) 1881 Are You Caring Enough for Hyperborean Radio (Uncensored)?",2022-11-03 23:59:24+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/2375,,,566,0,6,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2022-11-03 23:57:14,2022-11-03,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/10397,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sound of malformed feet, swiftly making their way closer. As far back as the stories go, no one ever got a good look at the Pitty Pat, for it is strictly nocturnal. It was described only as a shadowy, animalistic being that had an unsettling, human familiarity about it. The creature is said to dwell on Shipley Hollow Road, which is sometimes called Pitty Pat Hollow. The first accounts of the Pitty Pat came a few years after the end of the Civil War. Probably one of the most common stories tells of a mother traveling with her infant son, in a horse-drawn buggy. It is said that the horse was the first to sense something wrong. The animal knew danger was close. It reared up, and took off at full speed. Taking a sharp bend, the buggy overturned , throwing the two passengers into the woods. When the mother set herself straight, she realized they were not alone. She frantically began looking for her son, who she could hear crying, but saw nothing in the pitch blackness of night. Then she heard something else among the cries of her child. Pitty pat, pitty pat, pitty pat She could just barely make out a figure, thin and slightly hunchbacked, walking on two legs. She had the strangest feeling that it was not quite human. She was completely paralyzed with fear, and unlike most mothers, did not make any effort to defend her child. The creature took the boy, and disappeared into the night. In another story, a steamboat captain was returning home on the same path that the baby went missing, when a ""shadowy creature"" appeared and began chasing him. The captain pounded on the door of the first home he happened upon, and not waiting to be invited in when the startled couple opened up, he jumped into their bed and stated ""I'm staying with you tonight!"" Stories continued to circulate for years about the dreaded hollow and the fearsome entity who inhabited it. Some reports suggest that there is more than one Pitty Pat. In the early 1900s, a doctor was traveling through the hollow on horse and buggy, when he began hearing shrieks and chittering from the tree tops, in all directions. He also described the signature pitty pat, pitty pat, pitty pat... only this time, there was most certainly more than one Pitty Pat pattin'! Then two shadowy figures jumped from the darkness, and onto the horse's back. The animal lost all composure and took off running as if hellfire was lapping at its hooves. The horse became detached from the buggy, the things still on its back as it ran off, abandoning the doctor. The man swore he heard the creatures cackling as they rode away. The stories have become a local favorite to tell in modern times, to give folks a good scare, and given the silly sounding name, maybe a good laugh as well. But all jokes aside, many will admit to feelings of unease while walking through the hollow at night. Some say they feel they are being watched...and some still swear up and down that they will hear the Pitty Pat's pitty pattin' behind them.",2022-11-02 14:57:44+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/2363,,,506,0,5,1,PeerChannel,1708539788.0,storytellingtradition,2022-11-02 05:28:36,2022-11-02,https://t.me/storytellingtradition/536,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If Halloween is so Pagan and not secular what is the point of a Haunted House then?! - Well I'm glad you asked. Juss calm down a second an I'll explain to you something you already know. Fear! Fear dear child is the name of the game and what is Fear except a thing to be faced? To be overcome! The nameless and faceless horror of the dark oozing dread and despair! Well the haunted house as we think of it now is just a continuation of what once was when great festivals echoed and rang across the land when great play acting sets were erected across the country side with one soul purpose... to inspire pure and unadulterated TERROR in the hearts of the meek, the mild hearted, the gullible and the naïve! To what purpose? Well to teach them that they do have courage should they choose to use it. Once we created entire armies and entourages of spooks and specters and nameless horrors to traipse across the moors and fields beating their war drums and blowing their hunting horns for the entire purpose of the young to face in their fear of the unknown. Children and... let us call them ""children"" would be sent out into the countryside at night unaware of the inside joke that was being played on them as all manner of clamoring and howls of fear and anger and despair and DEATH were howled across the land. All with the express purpose of them being able to find their courage... after all how can one find courage without first knowing fear? What is courage? Well that is another conversation! Now stay on topic! Well see these customs began to be frowned upon by those who seized power through various means and so the Haunted House was invented to take its place. With something as simple as do you have the courage to enter the dark door and pass through the dark passage ways to exit into the light of courage. And a game of sorts has even sprang up among the young now who are unfortunately aware of the trick being played of 'Can you make it all the way through without crying out in fear or jumping like a cat at a slammed door?"". So yes it is a Pagan custom of testing your nerve, your courage for those who are young or frail of heart. A small test so that they might learn who they are... that they can find courage even in the absence of light.

msg_iteration.3753.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.2292,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,2292,,"Hyperborean Halloween #1: Scarecrows The humble scarecrow symbol of rural life, Harvest time and holidays like Halloween and Thanksgiving. But there is more to this idol than meets the eye... for starters ever notice he doesn't scare away crows? The reason for this is that scaring birds away is actually not ideal as birds tend to eat pests more than they do seeds. But mostly this is not the purpose of the Scarecrow. So what is his purpose? Well... people like him of course! Same reason we do anything -oh you wanted more? Like Lorewise? oh ok- *Ok grab a beer and sit down for a moment.* Modern scarecrows are centuries old but descend of much older customs. Notably the idol of the fertility god in the field as seen with the Corn Giant Wode or the Greek Priapus. The latter of which often had an idol kept in the field -sometimes with a threatening message of gross sexual harm by the god on anyone who messes with the garden, Greek gardeners weren't messing around- Meanwhile in Germany and the German Diaspora we find the tradition of The Butzemann, a plant spirit placed into a Scarecrow to guard and tend fields. Near Halloween The Butzemann is burned and its spirit is taken by The Wild Hunt, in Pennsylvania Dutch tradition The Butzemann is take by Frau Holle and allowed to reincarnate from her mill. In Saxony-Anhalt the Giantess Frau Harke appears as a Scarecrow in carnival processions. In the modern day Scarecrows are more a Halloween and Thanksgiving decoration found at your neighbors home vs. the Rural fields. However the Scarecrow has immortalized itself in modern culture. Appearing as the Monster in Jeepers Creepers, a recurring villain for Batman, as well as the Companion of Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz. So next time you see a Scarecrow in the fields or in the foyer, remember the long long history and the gods and ghosts who like to smile from its burlap and pumpkin headed visage. -TLK Scarecrow by Charles Livingston Bull Are You Studious Enough for Hyperborean Radio (Uncensored)?",2022-10-28 01:58:48+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/2292,,,595,0,6,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2022-10-28 01:53:32,2022-10-28,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/10365,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are Just the Ancestors come to visit. Sure some may be angry, others a bit more temperamental or needy but the ghosts of our dead are nothing to fear. They come on the wind, beside the hunt bisaddle and side saddle, they ride on the North Wind to arrive at our doorstep following the Ghost Lights, The Will'O'The-Wisp's and Jack O'Lanterns. They come as black dogs, furious riders, hopeful gnomes, and helpful mice wearing a bonnet three centuries out of fashion. They are here to visit the living, leaving the Meadows and the Sunshine of the Otherworlds. They peek from the rafters and behind the hay bales, seeing how their descendants are carrying on. If they find us fitting they may choose to stay. Becoming a House Spirit... for a time. They come with the gods and the other spirits of the land. They arrive for a meal, they trick or treat with Buzz Lightyear and Iron Man that one kid that showed up out of nowhere... that one just a bit off. If you are fun enough, interesting enough, caring enough perhaps they will choose to stay with you. For many they find fear in this, a door closed surprisingly! Something going bump in the Night! Or perhaps a light was turned off before your eyes! DON'T PANIC! The door being closed may be Grandpa Tom ""Shut that or we'll get a draft! No I'm not turning the thermostat up you pussy!"" or perhaps the attic going BUMP! was Aunt Dolores ""Well I always thought the Couch was better close to the window"" or the light being turned off may be Dear Old Dad ""Turn off the lights when you're not in the room Buddy"". These hauntings are more than likely just our family ghosts and they are doing family things. Whether they be Hobgoblins, Brownies, Lares, Domovoi or Nisse. Since the Long Long Ago when we Buried our Dead in our Homes, when the mounds were both houses and tombs, when the groves were the forests of the dead. Our dead have always liked to stay close to us. Many today grow scared when they show up, when they try to clean or tidy up, or let you know you're not alone in a world where most of us are. Don't fear or panic, it's just our Family Ghosts. Be respectful, be welcoming, be understanding and do not be rude or insulting. I mean if you came all the way from the land of the dead for a visit would you not be mad at such disrespect? Might even leave in a huff with a few things broken for good measure? So if it is a Haunting you Wish, best be fun! Best be grand! Best be caring! Ask yourself what kind of ghost wants to be around ungrateful and fearful descendants? They're on vacation after all.

I've loved it when I was a kid going as a Werewolf, Pirate Ghost and Post-Apocalyptic Raider house to house Trick R' Treating. It has been my favorite Holiday since I can remember and to be honest it's never been about the candy. It was about the feel of Halloween, while I was young I didn't quite understand it, we've all heard the ""Halloween was Invented by the Candy Companies"" line at some point, but that is a lie. Halloween is a very, very old Holiday. Last year we posted many times on the Lore and History of Halloween and its customs, rather than rehash the same ideas by rote I thought I'd just collect them for ease of access. 2021 Halloween Posts Trick R' Treating Spirit Animals Witch Gods The Eternal Hunter Masking Ghosts Goblins The Grim Reaper Veles & The Dead Will-O-The-Wisp Chernobog Black Dogs The Wild Huntress Vampires Goddesses of Death Food of the Dead Samhain & The Bear King Booo!

You can feel something more in the air when the Ghosts & Banshees, Gnomes & Goblins are all ready to revel alongside us! Despite all the pushback Halloween has received from the powers that be it is still to this day a Holiday that is beloved and treasured.

He appeared during the time span of 1966-1967 (Though many claim he is much older). He is described as having large wings and glowing red eyes. He is often thought to be a Sandhill crane or other bird. However, aside from the usual legends of flying over cars and scaring a passerby the Mothman is also connected to the deaths of 46 people as he was spotted and connected to the Silver Bridge Collapse in 1967. After this the Mothman became more associated with being an omen of destruction or misfortune, perhaps a spirit who feasts on fear?! (According to the Locals who know the Lore, only idiots and tabloids think he causes the bad things he is a warning an omen bringer according to them) In typical American Fashion the Mothman is often considered either a Nuclear Mutant or an Alien. As such the Men in Black ended up being mixed into the story somehow. Whatever someone may think of Mothman his status as one of the most popular figures of American folklore has been cemented over the years with the Mothman Prophecies Book and Film, the Fallout Games, his yearly festival on the Third Weekend of September and the many customs, art and stories created in his name. During Mothman's festival there is a custom of leaving a light on for him, in doing so one invites him to visit their dreams. While those who see him as a monster may balk at that, those who view him as a guardian and a bringer of omens welcome the Mothman in.",2022-10-12 00:52:18+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/2149,,,654,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An incredibly iconic artist who similar to Doctor Seuss while he mostly made genre specific art, for Spiegel (Seuss) it was children's art for Frazetta it was high fantasy and science fantasy but both also made comedic erotic art. Like the piece above that was made by Frazetta and never really exhibited -it was apparently something he would show guests for a laugh- The extremes of the ""Wholesome"" and the more ""Irreverent eroticism"" present in many American artists portfolios reminds me of our history. On the one hand you have the cleaned up bible preacher going out west and then you have the realization the popular folk song ""She'll Be Coming Around the Mountain"" is about men being excited for the arrival of a prostitute.

Robert left his mundane life behind him in 1955 when his marriage failed. He hitchhiked from Morganton, North Carolina to Fort Fisher on the North Carolina coast, where he made his new life, just in the edge of the Cape Fear River in the Fort Fisher Recreation Area. He furnished his home from driftwood he collected and lived on a diet of fish, clams, oysters, shrimp, snails, and crabs. Many people came from all over to pay him visits and talk to him about his life and philosophies, often leaving donations in a frying pan. ""Everybody ought to be a hermit for a few minutes to an hour or so every 24 hours, to study, meditate, and commune with their creator ...""- Robert Harrill Robert lived as a hermit for 17 years, until 1972 when his body was found. Fred Pickler, who was in the process of writing a book on Robert, was the one who found his body. Fred stated; “I went in, the first thing I saw, he was laying on his back and his arm was up like that...He was dead. Obviously. He was covered with sand. He had cuts on his arms, on his face, like he'd been drug on the ground.” Cause of death was labeled ""heart attack,"" however locals believe he was killed by 3 drunk teenagers, who a fisherman allegedly witnessed running from the entrance of the trail that led to Robert's bunker. No autopsy was done. The true cause of his death remains a mystery. Robert is buried at Federal Point Cemetery near Fort Fisher. His headstone says, ""He made people think.""

The divine ancestor and form often taken by many of our gods. Even in American Towns local Bear Cults still exist and gods such as ""Mama Bear"" exist as forest bear gods in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan for the European Americans. There is a myth that falls into this pattern supposedly from The Shasta Tribe of Northern California, but... well.... you'll see what I mean. It tells of ""The Great Spirit"" (Which isn't really a thing its a Christianization of Injun Animism) creates golden haired bears who walk on two legs and use clubs. Mount Shasta is considered the homeland for The gods and animal spirits and a place of eternal summer and reincarnation. After a mighty storm the Red Haired Daughter of the Great Spirit is flung out and taken by a bear to his family, where she is breastfed by the bears and eventually marries his son. The result of their union are the first humans with beautiful reddish skin (Not Copper, reddish) The Great Spirit is furious and curses the bears to be unable to talk, use tools and forced to walk on all fours. Taking his daughter back into Mt. Shasta.

The Animals became his friends he traveled with a Wolf who he'd helped out of a trap who ran with him through the moonlit trees. At some point the spirits of the Forest came to him and he became betrothed to some of their maidens, though he refused them in life they could have him in death. Yes there is much much more to Johnny than just his apples. I spect he forgot more than most of us know. In his death he knew his work weren't over and he bent a tree to plant itself and then all the apples across America."" ""Even in death he dint cease, when he went on to the realms beyond he planted a heavenly orchard that you see up there in the clouds"" at that we heard a chirping of a bird as a Cardinal flew into view. ""Seems Johnny liked the story boy, those Cardinals are friends of Johnny's they knew him in life and they sing for him in death. Now I'll ask ya again"" he bent over that same glint in his eye ""what do you know of Johnny Appleseed?"" I squirmed slightly as he smirked, he'd gotten the reaction he wanted. He chuckled slightly and motioned for me to stand ""Well no use dawdling let's get those apples or your Mother 'll have my hide"" I followed after him slightly perturbed, until finally I said ""None of that sounds real! It sounds like you made it up on the spot! Johnny is just a fairy tale a weirdo from olden days who planted trees whats the big deal!"" My Grandfather turned to me an apple in hand he knelt down so we were eye to eye and held out the apple to me ""Here, take a bite"" he said. My anger fled me and I did as he asked. As I bit into the crisp apple the Cardinal flew to me and landed on my hand, looking right up at me its eyes glimmered with a sort of kindness I'd only seen in men like my Grandfather, patient and well lived. The Bird tilted its head side to side and flew away with a chirp. My Grandfather stood up ""Well let's keep going, the apples ain't gonna pick themselves."" I followed after still not sure why, but I felt something... something fuller as I watched the Cardinals frolic apple tree to apple tree and the sun began to fall. ""I'm going to pick them"" I said running after him. He shifted his eyes to look at me, and smiled.

I recognized it and asked mockingly ""Oooh is that from Johnny Appleseed?"" That had been a mistake the stern White Bearded face of my Grandfather turned to stare at me with that mischievous glint in his eye common among Grandfathers. ""Oh and What do you Know of Ol' Johnny Appleseed?"" he motied for us to sit beneath an Apple Tree and fell to spinning a Yarn as he was oft to do. The Wind caused the swaying of both branches and beard granting the whole story a more dramatic tone. ""Johnny weren't this scrawny pencil necked little twerp you see in the movies. He were a beast of a man, strong as an ox, a bronzed hide, his beard and hair grew long and wild and neath his hat were piercing eyes. He carried a tome of sacred knowledge, his sack was full of forest medicine. He ran with wolves, fought serpents and Indians. He was even betrothed to Forest Maidens, old spirits of the wood."" He stroked his beard as if in thought than resumed . ""Though perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself, let's start at the beginning shall we"" He straightened his back and pointed to the sky, fluffy white clouds rose from the hills and spread across the horizon ""See that"" he asked looking at me, I nodded. ""Without Johnny, wouldn't have that Apple Blossom Sky there"" he chuckled softly ""born at the birth of our Nation he was, grew up crowded on all sides. He'd move this way or that"" he mimed Young Johnny's movements ""and run into his brother or sister. So when the Pioneers flowed west he naturally followed suit quickly getting ahead of them into a land of Mountain Men, River Rats and Forest Warfare. Such was Johnny that he walked barefoot his feet quickly cobbling his own boots of flesh, he could walk through both fire and ice on those feet of his. Even red hot pokers could not pierce the soles of his feet. He had nothing but the clothes nature grew for him or the tattered remains of Christian Charity while in the wilderness. He'd meet and make friends with many Varmints, some say he even met Paul and Babe. Using his knowledge of Forest Medicine to aid a sickly Babe. He planted his Orchards seed by seed all across the frontier, doing battle with Indians, Snakes and British Soldiers. The Forest was older then, full of spirits and magic. Though even here in the Orchards you can feel something else"" he turned away and looked around and a chill ran down my spine. ""The Indians came to view him as a Holy Man a Heathen Her..

Cleave the tough greensward with the spade; Wide let its hollow bed be made; There gently lay the roots, and there Sift the dark mould with kindly care, And press it o'er them tenderly, As, round the sleeping infant's feet, We softly fold the cradle sheet; So plant we the apple-tree. What plant we in this apple-tree? Buds, which the breath of summer days Shall lengthen into leafy sprays; Boughs where the thrush, with crimson breast, Shall haunt and sing and hide her nest; We plant, upon the sunny lea, A shadow for the noontide hour, A shelter from the summer shower, When we plant the apple-tree. What plant we in this apple-tree? Sweets for a hundred flowery springs To load the May-wind's restless wings, When, from the orchard row, he pours Its fragrance through our open doors; A world of blossoms for the bee, Flowers for the sick girl's silent room, For the glad infant sprigs of bloom, We plant with the apple-tree. What plant we in this apple-tree! Fruits that shall swell in sunny June, And redden in the August noon, And drop, when gentle airs come by, That fan the blue September sky, While children come, with cries of glee, And seek them where the fragrant grass Betrays their bed to those who pass, At the foot of the apple-tree. And when, above this apple-tree, The winter stars are quivering bright, And winds go howling through the night, Girls, whose young eyes o'erflow with mirth, Shall peel its fruit by cottage-hearth, And guests in prouder homes shall see, Heaped with the grape of Cintra's vine And golden orange of the line, The fruit of the apple-tree. The fruitage of this apple-tree Winds and our flag of stripe and star Shall bear to coasts that lie afar, Where men shall wonder at the view, And ask in what fair groves they grew; And sojourners beyond the sea Shall think of childhood's careless day And long, long hours of summer play, In the shade of the apple-tree. Each year shall give this apple-tree A broader flush of roseate bloom, A deeper maze of verdurous gloom, And loosen, when the frost-clouds lower, The crisp brown leaves in thicker shower; The years shall come and pass, but we Shall hear no longer, where we lie, The summer's songs, the autumn's sigh, In the boughs of the apple-tree. And time shall waste this apple-tree. Oh, when its aged branches throw Thin shadows on the ground below, Shall fraud and force and iron will Oppress the weak and helpless still? What shall the tasks of mercy be, Amid the toils, the strifes, the tears Of those who live when length of years Is wasting this little apple-tree? ""Who planted this old apple-tree?"" The children of that distant day Thus to some aged man shall say; And, gazing on its mossy stem, The gray-haired man shall answer them: ""A poet of the land was he, Born in the rude but good old times; 'T is said he made some quaint old rhymes On planting the apple-tree.""",2022-09-26 12:49:43+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/2005,,,554,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.4109.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.1923,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,1923,,"The Origin of Paul Bunyan's Ax One of the most iconic tools of any being or hero of folklore is the ax of Paul Bunyan. Now there are many tales told of how Paul came by his signature ax, the most common is that he made it himself pulling a whole towering pine tree up out of the ground to form the handle, yet perhaps my favorite has much more of that mythic nature to it that exists in many American myths but is so often buried by what sells at roadside attractions or Kids films. That he was given it by the spirits of the earth. Now see just like the Ax Paul himself has many origins from flocks of storks, to arriving washed up by the sea to being born of old trees and becoming a sort of forest god, but this one seems to follow the vein of Paul's origins that has him akin to Joe Magarac in that he was born of the mountains themselves. Molten ore flows through Paul's veins as much as steel forms the flesh of Joe. Born of the Earth it stands to reason he would pal around with spirits of the earth. Sometimes its dwarves, others gnomes, and some others are more generic in their earth spirits. But this story holds that Paul received his Ax as a gift from the Spirits of the Earth (Dwarves) and it was because he chose to leave his mountain home and go amongst man to show them how to live with nature. This was Paul's noble goal and his gift to his camp followers. It also shows why when people put profits before nature he fled North away from those who broke his heart. Either way Paul's Ax is an iconic image and is even a Trophy between two rival football teams.",2022-09-14 15:27:08+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/1923,,,1646,0,19,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.4153.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.1878,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,1878,,"Beards, The Hyperborean Mane HYPERBOREANS HAVE THE BEST BEARDS! Many foreign religions require beards to not be shaved, this is because the people these religions sprang from have wispy or nonexistent beards. What a single Virile Hyperborean Male -or Old Female- can grow in six months takes the other races a lifetime unless they season their genes with a bit of Hyperborean blood or employ surgical Beard transplants. Traditional Hyperborean Ethnic Faith lacks any rules regarding growing facial hair, because when a full grown male can shave on Monday and have a full beard by Sunday such rules are pointless. Meanwhile Dravidian Sikhs or Semitic Chimeras lack such beard growing genes and often are forced to use surgery and oils to artificially thicken their sparse beards. To mimic the fierce mane of the Hyperborean they must impose a shaving ban as they require decades to reach what we can grow in less than a year. They have disguised these traits of our race as theirs by selectively presenting those who more fit the desired stereotype while convincing our males they are full grown by 18 while all historical customs of the Old Ways point to late 20's to early 30's for true physical maturity for the Male Hyperborean. At which point not having a beard is a daily struggle that we often lose -ask the men who have to shave twice a day just to not have one- This is not to say our Beards do not have massive social, cultural, or spiritual significance. Almost all of our male gods are depicted with impressive beards, an insult for the longest time was to call a man a ""Beardless Youth"", touching another mans beard could result in a duel, and forcibly shaving a man was punishable by death or was reserved for massive punishments. Beards are also tribal signifiers with the texture, length, density, thickness, color and type being different tribe to tribe. These traits were so engrained culturally that we never thought to ban shaving because why the heck would you do that? But as the Church moved in and vilified hairiness as a mark of the devil and the weak chinned aristocracy demanded a false civility Beard Bans and Taxes were imposed -these laws are also unique to us as it never came up in the other races- The reality is Beards are not nor have they ever been a fad they are a mark of a healthy full grown man. The fad is shaving. Beards are natural and grow whether we want them to or not. Though as our Elders have said aside from Early Bloomers most beards are not full manes until around the age of 30, this fear of not having one has been trained into our young males leading desperate eager youths to destroy their beard by getting beard transplants while still too young to truly grow them. A form of racial vandalism.

An atavist of the days of blind chivalry he was, a knight errant in the somber clothes of a fanatic. A hunger in his soul drove him on and on, an urge to right all wrongs, protect all weaker things, avenge all crimes against right and justice. Wayward and restless as the wind, he was consistent in only one respect - he was true to his ideals of justice and right. Such was Solomon Kane"".-Excerpt from The Moon of Skulls by Robert E.

They are incapable of insulting or belittling Lee, because he was that good of a man.

For this deed that ended a war of brothers Lee was heralded as a hero and songs were written about him.

While in modern times, many of us would make such a trip with little difficulty, that was far from the case for our forebears. The number of deaths is a subject of speculation, as those who died were often buried in unmarked graves that were made to blend in with the landscape as to not be disturbed by animals or native tribes. Most does of disease, with cholera killing up to 3% of travelers from 1849 to 1855. Encounters with Indians also played a major role in the deaths of the pioneers. These attacks became such a problem that more routes had to be made to avoid savage territory. Other deaths came as a result of hypothermia, drowning while crossing rivers, wagon fatalities, snake bites, homicides, stampedes, flash floods, and even lightening strikes. Completion of the first transcontinental railroad in 1869, resulted in the decline of the trail's use. The train was cheaper, safer, and people lost their sense of adventure (I'm half joking). The Oregon Trail helped to expand our country. Many fascinating tales were born from the experience of those who braved this path, and I have decided to make a short series to keep their struggles, horrors, and triumphs from fading anymore than they all ready have.

For many of us these animals are a close family member, some even hold the opinion we are only still alive thanks to a pet. Whether as an emotional comfort or the animal literally saved our life. This is nothing new, thousands of years ago animals like domestic foxes and dogs were buried with messages of deep love for the animal: ""I am in tears, while carrying you to your last resting place as much as I rejoiced when bringing you home in my own hands fifteen years ago"" -Ancient Greek Writing on a Dogs Grave While many will claim animals ""Only do it for the food"" reality does not lend itself to this belief. Dogs have willingly given up their lives to defend their human friends even starving themselves to death to protect the humans corpse, cities report packs of dogs traveling on the bus to richer parts of town begging for food and bringing it back to their humans who are homeless. Affection goes both ways, individuals from certain groups such as PETA have viciously torn dogs from their humans who proclaim ""Anything else please! Kill Me! Anything but don't take my DOG!"" the dog will often escape but it is too late their human has passing on of a broken heart. This is not unique to dogs, horses have carried their unconscious riders off battlefields even dragging them with their teeth. Magpies, crows and many other birds will visit and protect their humans. Animals have long been companions of our people bears have been best men at weddings, opossums and raccoons have shown up to share a beer with people, whether rich or poor it is the true connection of the heart between two living things. Mutual friendship and understanding. Pets teach us to be truly human, to experience a connection with another living being without the cumbersome burden of social norms.

Tolkien Over the past decades there has been a slow and deliberate destruction of myths both ancient and modern. One by one the stories that build the culture have been retold in a method that demoralizes and twists their original purpose and intention. The disregard for both Mythic tales -Heracles, Thor, Faerie, The Wild Hunt, etc.- and the stories that were birthed from them -Lord of the Rings, Wagner's Operas, Shakespeare's Plays, The Witcher, etc.- is obvious and one can only conclude it is done either out of malevolence or complete indifference to the stories and those who treasure them. For these stories are Religious Stories they sprang from the Old Ways of Europe and have in many ways continued them. This is especially true for Tolkien's Works. As they were intended to be Tolkien's gift to his nation. A Myth for the English, the Hobbit's themselves are a love letter to the English Countryfolk. The Rings of Power takes none of this into account, it is not a Prequel it relies on the audiences ignorance of the source material to lie to them and remake Middle Earth -both Tolkien's and Our Own- for their benefit. To twist and make of them a mockery of what was created. It is not the first nor will it be the last to suffer such a fate. 25 Million have apparently watched it. While some likely hate watched it, most watched it because they wanted to. Because Lord of the Rings is not a Story to them, it is a brand. I Leave You With Two Thoughts To Consider 1. That unfortunately much to the chagrin of Tolkien himself Lord of the Rings has always been a darling of left leaning political activists. 2.

While John Addams is a super human warrior whose mother is eaten by a snake, Addams than seeks out a Mountain Fairy and with the aid of the Fairy's giant Eagle defeats the giant Snake and avenges his mother.

If you were born and raised in this area then chances are that your admixture is Celtic and Germanic. As a result, these regions are hotbeds for cultural celebration and enrichment! I spent the morning compiling a list of some of the most popular events and also a few directory links to help fill in the gaps. I included a few because the directories overlap with each other. Many from my list are included in one or more of the directories, but several are not. This list includes the states that I am familiar with but if you are in NY, NC, SC, TN, or KT, you have a ton of these Celtic celebrations around you. I really encourage you to do some research because I guarantee that there are plenty not in these directories that you can find with an intensive Google session. I’ve been to a good handful of the ones on this list and they are amazing experiences every time. These events are some of the best ways to connect with your roots and teach your children about their heritage. There are also loads of networking opportunities with different vendors, artisans, and historic/genealogical societies. I promise that your heart will swell when you experience this tiny taste of who you are, it’s like your blood remembers the sounds and tastes of your ancestral home. You will absolutely experience ethnic homogeneity and racial pride so please check them out!

Nowadays I don't think our sacks of flour would be very useful for clothing. Something most items no longer have is the ability to be upcycled, however whether marketing or simply being kind in a time when kindness was at a premium due to scarcity the flour bags would often be printed in patterns and some would even include doll cloth patterns to cut out. With the talents of the Wives of the time allowing for the upcycled items to actually be better than much of what's available nowadays.

The creature made regular appearances in the early tales of Paul Bunyan. In 1893, newspapers printed articles telling of alleged sightings of the Hodag.

There ARE records of a man named Aholiab Diamond, believed to be Moll's father, living in Lynn. Aholiab built a home and farm on ""140 square rods of land."" We don't know for sure when Moll Diamond was born, or where. What we DO know, is that after Aholiab Diamond and his wife died, their sons inherited their property. After the brothers died, their sister Mary (Moll) Diamond, was the only remaining heir. Somewhere along the way, she married, and her surname became Pitcher. Sometime after marrying, she gained a reputation as the town fortune teller. She thrived in her profession, making ""successful predictions,"" for the poor and rich, alike. Many women sought her out, to learn who they were destined to marry, while others went to reveal the fidelity of their spouses. Treasure hunters came to her for guidance of the location of their desire, but she would often turn them away, stating that if she knew such a location, she would keep that information for herself. It seems that this wasn't so much because she was a greedy woman, but rather, had a very keen judgement of people. She had little patience for those who only wished to make themselves richer. Moll's main method of divination, was reading tea leaves. She frequently read for noblemen, with whom placed the utmost confidence in her prophecies. The table in which she conducted her talents remains in her home, which is now a historical landmark. Moll Pitcher died in 1813, at the age of 75. She was buried on an old burial ground, located on the western side of Lynn.",2022-08-10 23:59:08+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/1694,,,480,0,2,1,PeerChannel,1708539788.0,storytellingtradition,2022-07-29 20:14:32,2022-07-29,https://t.me/storytellingtradition/402,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The general story is that Molly Pitcher would take buckets of water out to the battlefield earning her nickname of ""Pitcher""until her husband was killed in battle and she threw down her pitcher and took his spot at the cannon for the duration of the battle. At some point her legs were shot off by an enemy cannon sending her petticoat flying. Though for her heroics she gained other epithets including ""Captain Molly"" as well as ""Sgt.

Settled in 1869 by Swiss Immigrants mostly artisans. Helvetia is a little taste of Alpine culture in Appalachia. The area like most had their German heritage downplayed in WW2 but has persevered regardless. Named after the Helvetii Celtic Tribes that settled in the Swiss Alps the area continues the culinary, linguistic, and artistic traditions of Switzerland. Especially notable is their celebration of Fasnacht (Swiss Carnival) which is combined with another Swiss Pagan rite of Spring Sechseläuten which burns the Böögg an effigy of Winter. In Helvetia the Böögg has been replaced with Old Man Winter but Green Men, Animal and Plant Spirits as well as ghosts and various traditional costumes such as Mountaineers predominate. Other elements of Appalachian Culture have bled into Helvetia including Appalachian folk music and Square Dancing. When Old Man Winter is burnt one is likely to hear Country Roads Take Me Home rather than a traditional Swiss song. The culture may be rich and the Cell Service may be nonexistent but Helvetia's population has sadly fallen to 59 and like many similar towns that preserved and perpetuated traditions in the USA such as the Amana Colonies in Iowa the town is dying.

Let's all panic! or naw, that is what the talking heads want but really what could it all mean? Is it real? What might be causing it? Hmmmm.... Between Lake Mead drying up, and The Water levels of The Great Lakes going down not to mention the constant drought of California you might think the world is running out of water especially when combined with natural aquifers drying up and the record breaking heat wave in the UK! With all of this fear mongering you would think the world is headed on a one way trip to the world of Mad Max a hellscape that only the WEF can save us from if only they had more money and a little more power and of course the little people like you and me are to blame! But it isn't true! We come bearing good news! The heat wave is not nearly as bad as you are told as these record temperatures are recorded from the blacktop tarmacs of airports! Did you know that? The problem is not how much electricity you might be able to conserve, the problem is not how much water you dare to use, the problem is not your lack of a Hybrid or Tesla. No most of the issues with environmental health globally is two fold. Removal of water from the water cycle and the wholesale transfer of biomass from one continent to another. Water and biomass doesn't just disappear as the talking heads would have you believe. As if the water landing on the ground or flushed down your drain just disappears never to return. However it can be removed, held in warehouses and shipped to other areas for redistribution. This doesn't even require a sinister global plan All it requires is profit, convenience and a little marketing. The reality is most people do not even realize they are participating in this scenario, many might have an idea but think it necessary to participate in for the health of themselves and their families. A price worth paying right? Just bottled water accounts for billions of gallons removed from the water cycle, that does not include soft drinks, juices, canned foods or any other of the millions of other products that take the water and store it in containers. And of course the removal and shipping of biomass from region to region only makes matters worse. How many billions of gallons of water for instance get shipped to The Middle East and Africa from America and Europe? Fertilizer shortages causing food shortages? Well how much biomass gets shipped back and forth across the oceans? The truth is this trading of the environment is beneficial to some few monetarily but it is also beneficial to certain territories which could use the extra biomass but this occurs at what cost? So what can all of us do about it? Stop participating and start spreading the word. The word is not Panic, The Word is Local.

He is considered Maryland's most famous hunter of the frontier. Browning's father had been an English soldier, but turned deserter, when he fled the Braddock Massacre in 1755. Meshach was raised in a secluded community, in the highlands of western Maryland. This community was fairly self- sufficient, wearing skins from the animals they hunted themselves. The women spun their own flax and wool. It seems the only thing this community relied on from outsiders, was gunpowder. Browning grew to be an expert on wild animal behavior. He was a professional gamekeeper, and has gone down in Allegheny Mountain history, as a legend in his tracking capabilities of white tailed deer, black bear, panthers, and wolves. Browning recounted his adventures of his ""expeditions and life-threatening encounters,"" in his book: ""Forty-four Years of the Life of a Hunter."" The book was revised and illustrated in 1859 by E. Stabler. The man thought very highly of himself, but his mastery of surviving frontier life, has given him notable folk-figure status, possibly a folk-hero to some. A Historical Marker in Maryland claims that Browning""killed 2,000 dear and 500 bear, in 40 years."" He died in Pennsylvania on November 19, 1859.

Which poses a rather important question. If a Good Movie Can be made when it is US Military Propaganda then why has the general state of film and media fallen to such depths of depravity and poor storytelling? If I had to hazard a guess the overall state is due to a combination of ""THE MESSAGE"" as people call it, as well as an attempt to tell stories for all peoples. But the storytelling styles of each race of man is different. Different things are focused on, seen as heroic, etc. Mwindo of Africa is what one would call a Gary Stu but is a great hero of his tribes. The various heroes of Chinese Folklore and culture are often given no backstory and simply appear demigodlike. Only given a semblance of backstory when marketed to western audiences. Our tales humanize our gods, they put our heroes through triumph and tragedy force them forward and never belittle them even at their darkest and worst points from Heracles killing his family, to the madness of Spiderman at his darkest moments. The fact this film has been received especially by our people with such heraldry and acclaim tells me that it was designed to appeal to us. They are likely doing much the same thing they have done in the past. They are gearing up for war in order to avoid the collapse of empire. They have starved us with their multicultural nonsense, stories for no one meant to divide, and as such we are desperate for heroes. Then the good media will come out, with Government sanctioned heroes, and they will have us in their spiders web once more. We cannot allow a repeat of the past, we must be aware of what they are doing. Do not let them tell tales of control, remember the great stories of our past and deny their corruptions and their control. -TLK In association with Hyperborean Radio, Wylder Homes Project and BC Neanderthal Mindset",2022-07-13 16:16:58+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/1613,,,443,0,10,1,PeerChannel,1765305357.0,Neanderthalnews,2022-07-13 16:13:50,2022-07-13,https://t.me/Neanderthalnews/125,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was sent by the King of Sweden to Paul Bunyan's camp and served as a foreman. However he tried to overthrow Paul Bunyan and take over the camp inciting the men to rebel. The two ended up coming to blows and their fight was such that it created the Black Hills. The two men eventually made peace and helped to build the American Nation forward. It is interesting that this Scandinavian Giant is named after the goddess Hel, even if done on accident it does create a rather unique figure with call backs to the older mythologies of Europe in some ways a line from the Old Gods to the New Ones.",2022-07-11 00:13:12+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/1606,,,560,0,12,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The settlers called it, schneller geist, which translates to ""quick ghost."" This creature was said to be a reptilian bird-like behemoth, with enormous wings, a single eye in the center of its ghoulish face, and a metallic beak, with jagged sharp teeth. Over time, the name changed to ""Snallygaster."" The Snallygaster was reported to swoop down from the sky, and snatch up people and livestock, carrying them away forever. The settlers painted seven-pointed stars on their barns, in the hopes to keep the beast away. These can still be seen today. I Suppose it worked, as stories abruptly stopped until the early 1900s, when sightings of abnormally large birds were reported throughout the state. The stories caused such a stir that the Smithsonian Institute offered a reward, to anyone could bring them the creature (dead, I'm assuming). There was a rumor that at one point, President Theodore Roosevelt, actually put off an African Safari to hunt down the Snallygaster, himself. No such creature has ever been captured, but some believe that Snallygaster dwells somewhere within South Mountain (an extension of the Appalachias, between Maryland and Pennsylvania.)",2022-07-10 22:46:01+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/1604,,,395,0,3,1,PeerChannel,1708539788.0,storytellingtradition,2022-07-10 22:45:15,2022-07-10,https://t.me/storytellingtradition/382,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.4451.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.1572,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,1572,,"Fireworks, Midsummer, and the Star Spangled Banner One of the most iconic holidays in America is Independence Day, Fourth of July or simply The Fourth. It is a giant birthday celebration for the nation as a whole and is Summer's Greatest Holiday. The celebration is a fusion of unique American traditions and a Holiday that is conspicuously absent from America... Midsummer. The proximity of these two holidays caused one to be favored over the other and The Fourth ended up absorbing many traditions such as bonfires, picnics, Cook Outs and many other Summertime activities from Midsummer. Though American Specific Traditions were created as well such as; reading the Declaration of Independence, American Flag symbolism, wearing costumes of Minutemen, Columbia, Uncle Sam, etc. But possibly the most iconic tradition around Independence Day are the Fireworks for the Fourth of July. While they along with the sparklers and bonfires have some origin in Midsummer Customs they actually have an even deeper meaning for The Fourth. America's National Anthem comes from the war of 1812 written in honor of the defense of Fort Mchenry by Francis Scott Key. McHenry was bombarded from afar though by the end ""Our Flag Was Still There""; that is why we set off fireworks in honor of this battle. The part no one tells you is why the flag stayed standing. Man after Man had gone up to keep the flag flying their bodies fell where they stood, over and over forming a pile. Until the corpses themselves kept the flag aloft held up by the bodies of patriots. When we set off these fireworks it's not only a call back to a battle, to our national anthem. It is in honor of those brave souls who died that day.

There, she lived out the rest of her life, seemingly undisturbed. Legend says, on the day Grace died, her sons placed her corpse by the fireplace, and a gust of wind came through the house and carried her away up the chimney. A cloven hoofprint was said to appear in the spot where her body previously lay. After her death in 1740, stories were told of how the devil claimed her body. Supernatural storms were said to brew up over the bay in which she had been ducked, and strange black cats were seen hanging around Grace's property. The cats seemed to provoke fear the most, for the locals started killing every cat they came across. This is what likely led to a major rat infestation in 1793. Grace's home once stood at Muddy Creek, but over recent years, vandals attempted to burn it down so many times that eventually, nothing remained but the chimney, which was bulldozed in 2002. The land is now owned by the federal government and is part of the Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge. Grace Sherwood was the last person to be formally accused of witchcraft, in the State of Virginia. In 2007, a statue was erected of Sherwood. She was depicted carrying a basket of rosemary to signify her knowledge of herbal medicine, and a raccoon at her feet, symbolizing her love of animals. Some say that all of the rosemary that grows in Virginia, is the result of a sprig of the plant that Grace carried with her from England to the colony, in an eggshell. The bay in which her trial by ducking took place, was renamed: Witch Duck Bay. Locals of the present day claim that every July, a ghostly light, can be seen, floating over Witch Duck Bay. This mysterious light is believed to be the restless spirit of Grace Sherwood. *I claim no rights to these or any photos I use with my stories, unless otherwise specified.

msg_iteration.4493.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.1527,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,1527,,"The Witch of Pungo Grace White was 20 years old, in 1680, when she married James Sherwood, a poor farmer in the Colony of Virginia, town of Pungo. The couple had 3 sons. James died in 1701, leaving Grace, all 145 acres of his land. Grace used her knowledge of herbs and childbirth to make ends meet as a healer and midwife. Grace was said to be very beautiful, and her beauty only seemed to flourish as she aged. Some of the married local men fawned over her, which understandably, upset many of their wives, though it is said, Grace never showed interest in these men. So, with the stirring frustration of the men which manifested from constant rejection, and the hysterics a married woman may experience, knowing her husband lusted after other women, Grace became extraordinarily unpopular. The first accusations of witchcraft against Grace Sherwood, took place in 1697, when a neighboring farmer made the claim that Grace had cast a spell on his bull, causing it to waste away. The very next year, another farmer accused her of enchanting his pig and cotton crop. That same year, a woman claimed that Grace transformed herself into a giant black cat, entered the woman's home, and slashed her across the face before escaping through the keyhole. The courts in colonial Virginia, took no actions with these three cases, as the witch hysteria was never as severe here, as it was in say...Salem, Massachusetts. Even though nothing came of these incidents in a legal sense, Grace and her husband still had to pay court costs. In 1705, a few years after James Sherwood passed away, Elizabeth Hill, whose husband owned a farm down the road from Grace, accused Sherwood of bewitching her, and causing her to suffer a miscarriage, after the two women had gotten into a physical altercation. This time, Grace refused to appear in court. She was arrested. 2 juries were present, both entirely made up of women. Over half of these women feeling personally victimized by Grace Sherwood. Things weren't looking well for the accused. During this time, Virginia courts often dismissed claims of witchcraft, preferring not to stir up social unrest, but if enough people believed someone to be a witch, a trial would be held, however, the jury would have to provide proof in order to prosecute. (At this time, Virginia did not involve the clergy in judging legal matters, as Salem had.) 2 of the most common methods used in the identifying of a witch were used in Grace's trial: The women in the jury inspected Grace's body for ""witch marks."" These types of marks were usually just moles or birthmarks, but it was an easy way to ""prove"" one was in league with the devil, for it was believed these marks were given to witches when they made a pact with the devil. Four of these marks were found on the flesh of the Grace Sherwood. Though they were fairly certain that they had their proof by now, they decided to try one more test. The method of ""ducking"" a witch was one of the most widely practiced, during the witch hysterias of both Europe and the Colonies. This process involved submerging the accused in a body of water. Usually a weight of some kind would be attached to her feet. If she survived, she was guilty of witchcraft. If she drowned, she was innocent. Either way, in most cases, death would be her fate. And one early morning, Grace was rowed out onto the bay. She looked back at the crowd, a fiery hatred in her eyes. ""Before this day be through,"" she said to them, ""you will all get a worse ducking than I!"" A 13 pound Bible was tied around her neck, before she was dropped into the water. Grace was underwater for no more than 30 seconds before she managed to untie herself and reach the surface. After this, Grace was thrown in jail to await sentencing, but not much is known of what happened to her between 1705 and 1714. Many court documents were lost in that time frame. Records state that Grace Sherwood was released in 1714.",2022-06-24 03:56:38+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/1527,,,374,0,6,1,PeerChannel,1708539788.0,storytellingtradition,2022-06-24 03:44:55,2022-06-24,https://t.me/storytellingtradition/371,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We made the Injuns into something they weren't we made them a sort of untouched arcadian race, an idealized us without the blemish of sin or depravity. In many ways we placed our own ancestral ways onto them, we made them noble warriors even if by our standards they weren't, we crafted a false spirituality for them, false music, placing and mixing in elements of our own culture. We gave them sacred animals from our own ancestry, even when we shared these animals in common we thought they thought of them such as we did, when this was anything but the case.

And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there; O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep, Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes, What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep, As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam, In full glory reflected now shines in the stream: 'Tis the star-spangled banner, O long may it wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave. And where is that band who so vauntingly swore That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion, A home and a country, should leave us no more? Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution. No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave: And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave, O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

The poem was written by Francis Scott Key and was one of the most recognizable songs in the United States it was actually written in 1814 after Key witnessed the battle/siege and saw that by the end ""Our Flag was Still There"" or that despite the battle and bombardment the American Flag Still Stood.

Paul was never found. 1943: Carl Herrick went hunting with his cousin, Henry. About 2 hours into the hunt, the men were somehow separated. Henry went back to their camp, as the two of them had agreed to do so should one of them become lost. When several hours passed and Carl had not returned, Henry went to the authorities. A three day search ensued. As the sun was setting on the third day, Carl's body was found. He was naked except for his socks and boots. His rifle was found 70ft away, loaded, and propped up against a tree. A chewing tobacco canister containing methamphetamine was found near Carl's body. Even more perplexing, the autopsy revealed that Carl had been squeezed to death. His lungs punctured by his rib cage. Three hunters all disappeared in that very same area, in 1981. Unlike Carl, they were never found. What is interesting about all these cases, as expressed by investigator and writer David Paulides (who has several books based on mysterious missing person cases within America's national parks), are the similarities they share: All happened between October and January. Many were last seen between 3-4pm. There have been an equally divided number of women and men who go missing in this area. There are many theories as to what is happening in the Bennington Triangle.

In 1867, there were reports of a feral man living in a cave on the mountain. His stories are quite benign compared to others, as his only objective seemed to be intimidation with a pistol and sometimes exposing himself to women. In 1892, a millworker named Henry McDowell, killed a co-worker by bashing in the man's head with a rock. Henry blamed the incident on the voices he heard in his head. He was tried and committed to an insane asylum. He escaped the asylum, and was never seen again, but some said he went back to Glastenbury Mountain, living out the rest of his life, hiding out in the slopes. Some say his ghost still dwells there. In the early 19th century, a stagecoach carrying several people, was passing through the mountains near Glastenbury. A terrible storm was wreaking havoc, flooding the road. They had no choice but to stop. As the passengers huddled together for warmth, something spooked the horses, which threw the animals into a frenzy. The passengers could not make anything out in the darkness, but suddenly, a great force came down on the stagecoach. Whatever was out there had to have been enormous, for it shook the coach back and forth until it fell on its side. One passenger claimed he could, infact, make out the image of a large, hairy beast with glowing eyes. He estimated it to be 8ft tall. The press got wind of the story, and named this creature, The Bennington Monster. In more recent years, the Bennington Triangle holds some of Vermont's most disturbing cases of missing people. 1945: a 74 year old local man named Middie Rivers, a hunting guide, led a group of 5 men up Glastenbury Mountain. It was an ordinary day. But on their hike back to camp, Rivers, being very well acquainted with the land, went a little further ahead of the others. The other hunters figured they would find him back at camp, but when they arrived, they grew weary when they did not find him there. The next day, when there was still no sign of Middie, a search party was called. The search lasted for a little over a month, and no trace of the man was ever found. 1946: On the first of December, one of the most well known cases of those disappearing in the Bennington Triangle unfolded. 18 year old, Paula Welden went for a walk in those woods that lined her school's (Bennington College) campus. Multiple people saw her on the walking trail and even recalled that she wore a bright red sweater. When Paula didn't show up to her classes for a day or two, the sheriff's department was called. Surely Paula and her bright red sweater would be found sooner or later. 400 volunteers, including students and faculty helped search for the girl. The search expanded when the news spread. Soon the search party consisted of 1,000 people, 20-some bloodhounds, helicopters, even a psychic was brought in. The search went on for nearly 3 weeks, but a few days before Christmas, many people lost hope. Paula was never found. The case of Paula Welden inspired a superstition that one should never go into the woods wearing red. Columbus Day, 1950: 8 year old Paul Jepson had been playing outside at his family's junkyard. When his mother came to check on him, it was as if he had completely vanished. The junkyard was located within Bennington Triangle territory. Paul had been wearing a red jacket when he disappeared. Hundreds of people searched for the boy. It is said that the bloodhounds lost Paul's scent right around the area that Paula Welden was last seen, 4 years before.",2022-06-08 16:44:10+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/1436,,,353,0,5,1,PeerChannel,1708539788.0,storytellingtradition,2022-06-08 01:56:20,2022-06-08,https://t.me/storytellingtradition/351,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When Walt Disney wanted to make a feature length film he drew directly from European Fairy Tales with Snow White. With aid from artists like Gustaf Tenggren whose style was inspired by the works of Dulac, Rackham, Nielsen and Bauer. Animated Films were meant to be Fairy Tales Come to life! These beautiful pieces of art would eventually inspire Post-WW2 Japan in a boy named Osamu Tezuka who would combine Disney's Early Fairy Tale Style with traditional Japanese block print styles and create the modern art forms of Manga and Anime.

The Chuck Wagon often used easy to preserve items such as Beans, Salted Meats (Especially Beef), Coffee, Onions, Potatoes, Lard and Flour. The Chuck Wagon was often manned by a talented cook who was typically ill tempered due to lack of sleep and long hours. He was second only to the trail boss and had many nicknames including Cookie, Coosie, Sourdough, Puncher, Greasy Belly, Dough Boxer, Old Lady, etc. While the Chuck Wagon fell out of fashion after the 1880's it eventually gave way to both the American Diner and the Modern Food Truck. It's culinary mainstays and adaptable nature of its cooks fed into much of modern American cuisine. It's Name of the ""Chuck"" wagon can be traced to either a slang word for food or its supposed inventor Charles ""Chuck"" Goodnight.",2022-05-22 14:24:43+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/1346,,,991,0,26,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Household name with movies, books, comics, and an incredibly popular radio play staring Orson Welles. The Shadow is the predecessor to Batman, a dark and mysterious master of disguise, combat, and a great detective the Shadow would often find a way to entrap his quarry. In Many ways the Shadow originated the modern idea of the ""Supervillain"" with The Shadow's enemies serving as the template for such great antagonists as the Joker. His catchphrase ""Who Knows what Evil Lurks in the Hearts of Men? The Shadow Knows."" has been quoted time and again over the years appearing in cartoons of the time and video games of the modern day.

The tradition often involves some form of ""humbling"" act as well as a dip in sea water. What definitely occurs is that the Court of King Neptune appears, the Ship's captain and other shellbacks appear dressed as King Neptune, Triton, Davy Jones, Neptune's Queen, The Royal Baby (Typically the fattest man aboard), Bears, Mermaids, etc and then judge the Pollywogs before King Neptune's court. If they pass they become full fledged Shellbacks complete with certificate. The tradition is said to be 400 years old AT LEAST. It is likely far far older.

Due to the nature of Lobsters though there are incredibly important rules and traditions followed. These require an understanding of the Lobsters life cycle, habits and behavior on a deep level to be able to properly trap for Lobsters. Unlike other fishing industries, Lobster Fishing has remained largely small scale and family oriented with the various fisherman enforcing their own code of conduct such as limiting the number of Lobsters one can take or as seen in the above video marking breeding females to be unable to be kept. Lobsters can live over a hundred years being effectively immortal, only dying when they become too big to molt. As such a properly tended environment and population of Lobsters can feed people indefinitely but it requires understanding, genuine care and respect for these delicious buttery crustaceans.

The Prologue and the Promise is a massive Mural painted by Robert McCall at Disney's Epcot center, it is an example of the Utopian and Optimistic futurism that once predominated American's visions of the future, however these once lofty ideals have fallen by the wayside, as the future seems more and more bleak, and our once impressive ideas to better the lives of mankind and the world, left as nothing more than a naïve projection of our hopes and dreams and our ignorance of peoples greed and corruption.

Croswell (N.Y. 1804), his argument that Truth was a defense against Libel eventually changed the laws, and if something was True it could not be Libel, remember that. “The gist of Hamilton’s argument was that the truth of the claims made by an author should be admissible evidence for the defense in a libel case.

One story says he was brought by a flock of storks to his family, others claim he washed ashore in a giant basket, some say he was born a normal boy and was blessed by the Man in the Moon with his size and abilities. But my favorite story is that he was born of the forest itself. Immortalized in folk songs as ""Son of a Great White Oak was He! His Father was a Redwood Tree!"" Paul was born as a tree seed, usually an Acorn and from there he grew into a tree and decided he wanted to know what was over yonder hill and pulled up his roots and began to walk becoming the first and only ""Paul Bunyan Tree"", others have it closer to old Fairy Tales where he may have been born of an acorn but he grew into a man all the same, a large giant of a man the God of the Northwoods for the American People.",2022-04-07 15:06:41+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/1037,,,1081,0,11,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Every bit of our culture can be traced back as part of a line of ideas, creations, beliefs, and traditions that are ancient, follow any line long enough and it'll lead you to something extraordinary. Everything is a result of the culmination of choices and creations that were made over time, the good and the bad, enjoy the good, love what has been created out of love, joy, creativity, and in some cases sorrow and pain. To toss it away because it is new, or because it is not hundreds or thousands of years old in its current state is to not see the forest for the trees. I repeat it's ok to like stuff, it's ok to live to laugh and love, to cry and sing, and everything in between.

He also said to ""Grow in the air, eat and rest with the earth"". I think simple as this advice is, it's some of the best I've heard and something many could find value in, so I thought I'd share these words of wisdom from America's Poet.

In a complex industrial society, hero-making goes on at various levels, so that every walk of life and almost every occupation have their heroes. Thus, on the one hand, the schoolbooks and popular literature of edification draw upon the ranks of leaders—explorers, pioneers, soldiers, statesmen, inventors, and industrialists—for patron saints and tutelary geniuses, to inspire love of country or teach the ethics of success. On the other hand, the dime-novel concealed behind the geography book glorifies the gentlemen on horseback and the demons with the six-shooter. Midway between these two extremes is an American fairyland of strong men and giants who perform the impossible. - B.A. Botkin",2022-04-03 19:22:14+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/956,,,2420,0,29,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Loop Hill Ike was just that man. Ike was considered a ""Supernatural Bounty Hunter."" Ike had other talents aside from casting out ghouls and witches....he was also an astounding fiddle player. One night, Ike and his friend, Bud, attended a dance at an abandoned house in Elk Country. Ike brought his fiddle along. When they got to the house, Bud offered to play the fiddle while Ike danced with a woman he had been courting. About an hour into the festivities, a loud bang was heard from upstairs, as though a door has been slammed shut. This was followed by heavy footsteps coming down the stairs. No one could see anything, even when the being should have been right there in front of them. But then Bud yelled out that HE could see the ghost of a man. Bud was the seventh son of a seventh son. Superstition states, that the seventh son born of a seventh son would have the second sight. All the party goers fled from the house, except for Bud and Ike. Ike knew just what to do. He would play the fiddle for the ghost and make him dance. But Ike couldn't play for something he couldn't see. So, he went down to the lake nearby, and picked a bit of monkshood, and put it in his hat. Now he could see the ghost. Ike began to play, slowly at first. The Ghost began to dance. Everyone knows that ghosts can't resist a good tune. Then Ike began to play faster and faster. The Ghost clomped his feet, dancing away until he stepped in a hole and fell through the wooden floor. As the ghost was falling, he slapped the monkshood out of Ike's hat. After that the ghost disappeared. Something peculiar happened then, that even Ike couldn't explain. His fiddle would never play again. No matter if he ran the bow across the strings, the instrument would make no sound. Ike was buried with his fiddle on a hill in Clinton County. He was actually a real person whose birth name was Isaac Gaines. He is considered a folk hero in Pennsylvania.",2022-03-30 01:40:36+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/893,,,299,0,3,1,PeerChannel,1708539788.0,storytellingtradition,2022-03-29 21:07:11,2022-03-29,https://t.me/storytellingtradition/275,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A large portion of the population which continues to be unheard, mocked and ridiculed have opposed many of the actions of our government. For most of my life trying to get our ""war machine"" out of other countries we have no business in. Remember the people of America are not the government and have no more control over our government any more here than where you in your country. We do not get to vote on sanctions, trade deals, wars, laws, taxes etc. Our politicians lie, steal and sometimes murder to get into office then promptly forget their campaign promises the same as many of yours. And just like in your countries there are people who blindly support everything done in their name and some even fewer who knowingly support it. But most actually oppose what is happening here both politically and socially. Remember what you see of America and what most Americans see is filtered through the American propaganda machine. America itself having been on the brink of civil war for at least 2 decades even through distraction after distraction. Every crisis brought to the world stage from America is to stave off this imminent civil war which will be caused once again by states seceding from the Union that is the United States of America. -The Folks at The American Spirit",2022-03-27 05:51:36+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/883,,,684,0,13,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was invented in order to fill the Winter Months when Lacrosse and Football were unable to be played due to the cold weather, so that the young men could burn off the excess energy they accumulated without the other games. It combined elements of Rugby, Football, Duck on a Rock, and Soccer while toning down the physical interaction in order to avoid injuries that would increase without an open field to play in. Originally the basket was made of Peach Baskets (Originally meant to be crates, the circular shape was an accident). The game was an immediate hit and the 13 rules were published in the college magazine and basketball spread like wildfire. Today it one of the most popular games in the United States especially in March when ""March Madness"" is prevalent for the game.",2022-03-25 16:24:57+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/868,,,350,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.5154.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.852,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,852,,"Folklore of New Jersey: The Pine Barrens Once ranging North Carolina to Nova Scotia, the Pine Barrens are now a ""rare temperate coniferous forest ecoregion."" The ecosystem has been so badly damaged by urban development through the last few centuries, only about 10% of the original habitat remains. Other Sections of the Northeast United States that still contain the original Pine Barrens are: the New Jersey Pine Barrens; Long Island Central Pine Barrens in New York; and the Massachusetts Coastal Pine Barrens with concentrations in Myles Standish State Forest, Manuel F. Correllus State Forest on Martha's Vineyard, Cape Cod National Seashore and Joint Base Cape Cod and the Mashpee Wampanoag Indian Reservation in Massachusetts. Thankfully, these areas are well conserved. Before the Dutch and Swedes settled there, the Pine Barrens were inhabited by Lenape tribes. Today, much of the areas that underwent urban development have been abandoned. This seems to be the reason why the Pine Barrens of New Jersey has a quiet eeriness lingering over it. The ruins of old buildings and derelict houses can make you feel quite small and vulnerable. The legends don't help anything. The Pine Barrens have had much folklore attached to them for many years Jersey Devil: Probably the most well known legend of the ecoregion, is that of the Jersey Devil. According to the story, the creature was the 13th child of a 1700s woman, who could barely take care of her other 12 children. When she found out she was pregnant again, she declared: ""Let it be the Devil!"" The thing she bore was twisted and ugly, with large black wings, the body of a horse, and the head of a goat. The creature jumped out of the window and flew into the Pine Barrens, where people claim to see it even today. Captain Kidd: According to locals, the notorious pirate, Captain Kidd hid his treasure on Barnegat Bay, at the edge of the Pinelands, sometime in the late 1600s. Kidd's headless ghost is said have been seen over the centuries, walking along the beach with the Jersey Devil by his side. The Black Dog: We are used to hearing stories of spectral back hounds to be omens of death, but the black dog that haunts the Pine Barrens is said to be harmless. As the story goes, the ghost was the dog of a cabin boy on a ship. The ship was attacked by pirates, many of the crew were killed. Among the dead were this boy and his dog. The bodies were thrown into the water. A Pine Barrens island called Absecon Island was just half a mile away. It is believed the spirits of the boy and his dog did not know they were dead and made their way to the island. The boy's ghost has never been reported, but sightings of the black dog have been accompanied by human-like whistling. The Golden Haired Girl: A ghost said to sit on the rocks that line the beach at the edge of the forest, searching for her betrothed who was lost at sea. Some claim to have seen the Jersey Devil sitting beside her. The White Stag: A phantom white deer that is said to aid lost travelers. The deer has also been credited with preventing disasters. One story tells how it stopped a stagecoach from crashing into the Batsto River. Many believe that seeing this animal brings good luck.",2022-03-21 19:35:57+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/852,,,319,0,1,1,PeerChannel,1708539788.0,storytellingtradition,2022-03-21 18:28:26,2022-03-21,https://t.me/storytellingtradition/256,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We began tapping American Sugar Maple Trees way back in the 1500's and the rest is history. Each region thinks it has the best Maple Syrup, with Vermont and Canada being the most fervent in their Maple Syrup adoration. Syrup producing areas will often use Maple Syrup as their only sweetener, with the production, Maple Forests, and use of the syrup taking on near spiritual components. Personally I think the Maple Syrup from my Home State of Iowa is the best. The Syrup can be further processed into an amber like substance that can be made into ""Maple Sugar"". P.S.- The Amerindians did not have Syrup they had the Sap, but the making of it into Syrup was a Hyperborean addition much like we already did with other trees such as Birch.",2022-03-19 00:58:06+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/799,,,1731,0,23,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.5213.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.793,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,793,,"Bestiary Entry #49- Leprechaun Territory & Habitat: Ireland, North America, Wheel Wells of Commercial Airliners, and the dreams and ramblings of drunkards and fools. The Leprechaun is one of the most well known creatures of Irish myth, and as requested by L.O.R.E. I have proceeded to look into them and discover if they can be of some use especially in regards to an extra/paranormal source of funding. However, much of the lore involving Leprechauns is quite odd, and not the typical way but in the way one might find the ramblings of a drunkard or a fool to be. This seems to have been perpetuated by foreigners and the average person unaware of the broader lore of the Fey. As many old Irish people are rather adamant that Leprechaun's are a bastardization of the gods and fey, some specifically pointing to Lugh, though this seems to be based on little more than the start of their name. The Leprechaun sounds more akin to the story of the “Wild Haggis” or “Blarney Stone” a sort of practical joke that has gone on to the point of being a near tourist attraction. The Leprechaun is also very different in the Lore attributed to it in Ireland where it is a rather obvious Brownie or Pooka corruption, being a short man with a beard, red suit, and hat. One you may pass on the street without even noticing, almost a way of making fun of the Irish. However, in America from the Boston Celtics to the imagery surrounding Saint Patrick's Day and numerous poorly made films, the Leprechaun is almost always seen in a stereotypical Green costume with a Shamrock. In America the idea of Leprechauns having a pot'o gold at the end of a rainbow or granting wishes is most prevalent to the point that an obscure American custom is the making of “Leprechaun Traps” where one baits them with “Lucky Charms” or other colorful candies in the attempt to trap the Leprechaun on the eve of Saint Patrick's Day (Feast of the Smith) and have it in the morning and force it to grant wishes. As the Leprechaun and Saint Patrick's Day both served as a means to help the broader American populace accept the Irish, as they had been attacked and discriminated against for refusing to go along with the Church since days of old, and had been in America since day one. By and large the Leprechaun should not be taken seriously as it is more a modern bastardization that seems to mock the fey and gods of old Ireland. Then any real creature and even when not used in mocking is more of a Brownie than a separate class of creature. Eyewitness Accounts 1) Numerous accounts from Drunkards at Inns have been recorded but whether they can be taken seriously is up for debate. 2) L.O.R.E. Has attempted to inquire with many Elders of Irish clans and have been met with the resounding instance of enraged old Irish men raging and throwing things while declaring “There ain't no such thing as FEKKING LEPRECHAUNS, and there NEVER WERE! They are the invention of the Church perpetuated by liars, drunkards and fools!” 3) According to a common quote in America Leprechauns are often afraid of the many people who are “Always after me Lucky Charms” the exact Nature of these Lucky Charms varies one mister A. Powers says they are taken from the victims of the Irish assassins, while others claim they are a sugary snack food. Still others claim they are “part of a balanced breakfast” 4) According to a Mr. A. Szyslak they are native to Ireland but “they Come over 'ere in the wheel wells of Aer Lingus Jets”. Conclusion: Leprechaun's are more than likely just the inventions of drunkards and thieves and there will be no deals made for pots of gold for extra funding for L.O.R.E. I don't know if my Boss was playing a prank or dug into the whiskey too much to ask me to find Leprechaun's for funding, but I ain't going to the end of no Fekking Rainbow to find a “Pot of Gold”.",2022-03-17 16:49:21+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/793,,,287,0,2,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2022-03-17 16:43:31,2022-03-17,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/8616,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serving a 15 month prison term for ""assault"" Palmer would eventually leave after his mother pleaded him to pay the fine, which he had refused as it would be akin to admitting he was at fault.

Both of these animals are sacred to us as much or more so then the PNW Injuns. The Salmon of Knowledge, the Ravens of Apollo, Othin, and the Morrigan. Loki as a Salmon god, etc. No need to feel guilty at finding them important or even spiritual, and no need to adopt Haida symbols or get Haida tattoos, we have our own symbols, lore, and meaning with these animals whether in Europe or America.

While we did thin the herds in some cases, the Amerindians were doing the job well enough. After they got the Horse they began to drive Bison over cliffs enmasse. Hundreds if not Thousands of Bison chased over a cliff by screaming, loud noises, sharp implements and set wild fires. An effective but extremely wasteful form of hunting. The Plains Indians would then go to the bottom where the lucky bison that had died of the fall would have their livers and tongues, and only their liver and tongues taken. Leaving the rest of the meat to rot. The pile of skulls everyone shows that is supposedly the Pioneers doing is the same pile of skulls over and over, another method to guilt trip us, Europe too has Bison that was once sacred across the land, here we got a second chance with them.",2022-03-12 20:44:50+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/694,,,324,0,16,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He appeared during the time span of 1966-1967. He is described as having large wings and glowing red eyes. He is often thought to be a Sandhill crane or other bird. However, aside from the usual legends of flying over cars and scaring a passerby the Mothman is also connected to the deaths of 46 people as he was spotted and connected to the Silver Bridge Collapse in 1967. After this the Mothman became more associated with being an omen of destruction or misfortune, perhaps a spirit who feasts on fear?! In typical American Fashion the Mothman is often considered either a Nuclear Mutant or an Alien.

A drunk was logged as ""DD,"" which stood for drunk and dirty. A drunken crew member had one objective that had came up with the practice of granting shore leave.

He was the largest baby they had ever seen. He was far to heavy to carry, so 5 large birds had to pick him up to move him from place to place. By the time he was only a few weeks old, he weighed over 100 pounds. Growing up, Paul was ALWAYS hungry. He ate 50 eggs and 10 bushels of potatoes a day. By the time he was 13, he was so big, his parents had no idea what to do with him. One time, Paul rolled over when he was sleeping and this caused an earthquake. The earthquake brought a mob of angry townsfolk to the Bunyan's home. They demanded that Paul must go live elsewhere. His parents took him deep into the woods. This is where he would stay. In the woods, he helped his father cut down trees. This was easy work for Paul, as he had the strength of 20 men and he was very very fast. One day Paul came upon an unusual sight. I found a blue baby ox and decided to keep him. At night he put the ox in the barn with the other animals. In the morning the barn was gone and so was the ox. Paul found him grazing in a field. But the ox was no longer small. He had grown into a giant ox over night. So tall, his back (which now had the barn stuck on top of it) came up to Paul's waist Paul named the ox Babe. Paul and Babe left Maine and headed west to search for more work in the forests. On the way, Paul dug out the Great Lakes so that babe could have plenty of water to drink. They settled at a camp in Minnesota. Paul gathered other lumberjacks to help with the work. His crew became known as the Seven Axemen. All of these men were well over 6 feet tall and weighed over 300 pounds. Every Sunday, Paul and his crew ate pancakes. Each cake was so large, it took 5 men just to eat one. Paul always gave Babe a giant sugar cube as a treat after a hard day's work. It is said that Paul cleared many forests throughout the northern united states and parts of Canada. Babe died in South Dakota. It is believed he ate too many pancakes. Paul buried his companion there and this created the Black Hills. There are different versions of Paul's Fate. Some say that he was last seen in Alaska, or even the Arctic Circle. Other stories say that he returns to Minnesota or Maine every summer but that he moves in and out of the forest so many never know where he is.",2022-02-22 20:45:38+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/576,,,219,0,4,1,PeerChannel,1708539788.0,storytellingtradition,2022-02-22 20:04:55,2022-02-22,https://t.me/storytellingtradition/170,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was a flawed man but that is not the point, the point is that his actions, sacrifices, and legacy helped form this country and gave a place for the People of America to call their own. While many have tried to vilify him over the years. He has stood the test of time as a great hero of America's People. The Romulus of our lands.

The Nain Rouge (Red Dwarf) AKA The “Hell Goat” is a kind of imp or dwarf from Detroit Folklore. It is said to plague Detroit and be an omen of misfortune. It is said that the founder of Detroit Antoine de la Mothe, sieur de Cadillac was told to appease the Nain Rouge but refused to and instead beat it resulting in Cadillac being cursed with misfortune. While his name implies he is a dwarf the Nain Rouge is often depicted closer to a stereotypical Christian Demon or European horned god. Possessing Red skin, pointed ears, horns, claws, and a beard. With many calling him a “Lutin” or hobgoblin. The Nain Rouge is also the focus not only of being the harbinger of Detroit's Doom, but also being the figure at the head of the March of the Nain Rouge. Which is held every spring since 2010, the Nain Rouge as “The Harbinger of Doom” and “The Embodiment of Everything that Holds Detroit back”. At the end of the procession of floats, fire dancers, and people embodying the Nain Rouge an effigy of the Nain Rouge is burned to ward off the dwarf's supposed malevolence for a time. While this tradition is intended to keep the Nain Rouge at bay, a second part of the procession involving “Pro-Nain” protesters exists encouraging people to not shoo away the dwarf, though this seems primarily to be a tongue-in-cheek protest. While the tradition itself is fairly new, it is based on a shared cultural heritage of Detroit and New Orleans, as both were founded by French settlers hundreds of years ago, and is intended to unite Detroit. With the Nain Rouge becoming more a symbol of Detroit then a malevolent force in the modern day. With the aforementioned protesters saying things like “The Real Nain Rouge is Nice”. Eyewitness Accounts 1) The most famous account I have heard is from that of Cadillac himself, as he was warned of the Nain Rouge and told to appease it, but instead when it arrived he beat it with his cane, resulting in a curse of misfortune being placed upon Detroit's founder. 2) Other eyewitness accounts point to the times the Dwarf has appeared before catastrophe including: The Battle of Bloody Run (1763), The Fire of 1805, the 12th Street Riot (1967), among other events the city has faced. Conclusion: The people of Detroit seem to have it handled in terms of mitigating any curse, but even without the curse that Cadillac incurred, the city faces many issues of a more mundane and less magical variety, while the Nain Rouge may have caused some of it, there is no way to know how much one can blame on the dwarf and how much one must lay at the feet of man, but as is usually the case of history it is man who will bear the brunt of the blame and the consequences.",2022-02-17 18:07:40+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/559,,,222,0,0,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2022-02-17 18:07:24,2022-02-17,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/8001,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eyewitness Accounts 1) While scant, several eyewitness accounts point to them spreading across the Atlantic, if they have arrive in Minnesota it is doubtful the Barbegazi hasn't spread to other snow capped mountains in America, with a high percentage of Hyperborean population. 2) The whistling sound and helpful nature of the spirits marks them as generally kind and numerous eyewitness accounts mark them as a helpful Wild Spirit, akin to Basajaun. Though like any spirit, creature, or being of Faerie or Elphame the Barbegazi will have inevitable variation in personality and in reaction to various individuals. Conclusion: The Barbegazi is a wild spirit, ebbing and flowing with the seasons, it shows little sign of domestication unlike many helpful spirits I have reviewed, and instead has retained its wildness. While classified as Fey by many, it is closer in appearance to either a dwarf or Woodwose, neither of which is really a creature of Faerie. The latter of which tends to live in the wilds of the Mortal realm and at times is even a Hyperborean Human in its raw primal state, the former however would match both aspects of the physical description and living traditions of mountain caves. Indicating a possible demigod creature, as Dwarves are far more than Tolkien may have written about. No expert crafting beyond tunnel creation has been mentioned. It is by far a generally helpful spirit, as such I see no reason to worry about it atm, even with the Winter Olympics going on, it is more likely the Barbegazi will not set foot in China, as there is not enough Hyperborean blood to draw them there, nor are there any indications of an extant population in Oriental Territory. Unlike the Dogmen Barbegazi have not shown habits of bonding to individuals, and even if they did, its helpful nature would make it a boon to the athletes, and not a bane. L.O.R.E.

Creating an extant population in Northwest Minnesota. The Barbegazi “Frozen Beard” are Alpine spirits, primarily a kind of Faerie Folk, or perhaps Dwarf. They dwell in mountain tops primarily in the French Alps, though they are found in other regions as well. They are extremely hairy being covered neck down in thick white hair and possessing a massive white beard, which due to their cold environment is almost always covered in icicles, hence their moniker. They are most likely physical beings that can take advantage of the altitude, shadows, and underground passages that they live in, in order to cross between the realms. Though most likely they are also physically here, as they occupy land rarely seen by mortals. The Barbegazi are a variation on either a Woodwose or Dwarf style spirit in terms of both appearance and action. As the Barbegazi enjoy the cold, hibernating underground in their caverns during Summer Months, while coming out during the colder Winter months. They are also built rather like dwarves being stocky and powerfully built, with enormous feet that they use to slide down snow like skis or to walk atop massive snowfall akin to snowshoes. They are expert tunnelers far exceeding any burrowing animal of the mortal plane. Able to quickly burrow into snow and mountain rock, creating complex tunnel systems that they live in. They are helpful beings often whistling to warn of storms, or helping shepherds collect their sheep, they do this by letting out a whistling sound, and their tunneling ability has allowed them to dig people out of deep snow, saving lives. Their helpfulness to shepherds and their whistling to warn of storms reminds one of the Wildmen spirits or deities of the Basque Pyrenees Basajaun. One wonders if the two are connected given the interconnectedness or at least parallel evolution of the Lore of the Alps and the Pyrenees. All in all a fairly helpful spirit, they seem to enjoy riding atop avalanches, though whether they are able to cause them beyond the level of say, a very loud human I am unsure.",2022-02-06 15:30:44+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/542,,,210,0,0,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2022-02-06 15:28:51,2022-02-06,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/7808,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, not enough evidence exists to confirm or deny this hypothesis.

They take part in the battles and in some cases wipe out enemy encampments with “Dog Tracks” found all over, after the events. 2) Several sightings in the North-Western Lower Peninsula of Michigan including Gladwyn and nearby cities. The sightings are varied but consistent, with the Dogmen being credited with killing their “victims” and strewing their mangled corpses across multiple trees, from which the rotting flesh doth hang. 3) In the Upper Peninsula (from approx. St. Ignace to Escanaba) there are many sightings of the Dogmen, similar to in the LP. The people disappear but their bodies are never found, unlike in the LP. Bloodied clothing has been found but never the bodies. One wonders if this ties into their possible lycanthropic tendencies. 4) As the Dogmen serve as guardians and protectors they are often left gifts of clothing and food. Close to Omar, Michigan. People would often take food and clothing to an abandoned cabin as thank you for the protection the Dogmen had given them. Conclusion: The Dogmen are mysterious, it is unclear if they are Wild Men, Werewolves, Guardian Spirits, or something else entirely. Among the Hyperborean's of the Upper Midwest, especially Michigan, they are seen as benevolent and well liked. Despite their unpredictable actions and violent tendencies. I see no true harm they can do, no more damage than one can find in a Gargoyle's territory or that of a Grimhound. Similar to the latter, I see no way to possibly contain the beings. As even if they are physical, as the locals say “They are very good at hiding” and more than good at killing.",2022-02-04 15:35:05+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/537,,,190,0,0,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2022-02-04 15:29:08,2022-02-04,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/7740,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msg_iteration.5467.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.536,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,536,,"Bestiary Entry #38- The Dogmen Territory & Habitat: The Dogmen are a group of woodwose and werewolf style beings that predominate in the area of the Upper Midwest Great Lakes Area. Mostly in Michigan and Wisconsin. Typically in wooded areas though they can extend into rural areas at times. It is unclear if this is the same species known as the Cynocephalus from Medieval texts, such as that which the Orthodox Church draws their Saint Christopher. While this species or subspecies of spirits are mostly in the Upper Midwest, they are known to travel and have traveled across the United States and abroad in order to follow and/or protect those they attach themselves to. The Dogmen are beings that live in America and may or may not have come over from Europe (It is unclear if they emigrated with people, or if they are some kind of cryptid.) They appear in multiple forms sometimes appearing as a Werewolf style beings, while others depict them as Woodwoses or Bigfoot-like beings. The Dogmen are in the popular consciousness merely monsters, cryptids or beasts of physical form either as Lycanthropes or as Bigfeet. However, after further study I think this is but a popular fallacy not dissimilar to the equivalency of the Fey and Elves in many peoples mind. The actual lore and animistic practices of the Hyperborean Michiganders does not suggest a mere beast. They live in the wilds of Michigan and the nearby States, where they are said to protect the good and punish the wicked. With people often leaving gifts to them, such as food or clothes. With certain campgrounds and old cabins being hot spots of the Dogmen. They are said to be dog headed, fur covered men. Being man shaped in all but their head. The Dogmen have been said to have followed the individuals they have bonded with (Unclear as to the process or reasoning behind this) to Afghanistan, and there are even stories of them fighting in the USA Civil War. They are not spirits in the sense that most would see them, rather they are physical beings though in what way is unclear. Not dissimilar to Saint Christopher, the Wulver, or the Cynocephalus of Medieval travel logs they are said to be real physical beings similar to the Trolls of Northern Europe. They are said to simply be good at hiding.",2022-02-04 15:34:57+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/536,,,198,0,0,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2022-02-04 15:28:41,2022-02-04,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/7739,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the Pennsylvania Dutch AKA Deitsch there is a tradition of the “Butzemann” the Butzemann is a scarecrow and protective totem, that around Groundhog day is activated (Often by a witch) embodying a kind of nature spirit, neither the scarecrow nor the spirit alone is necessarily the Butzemann, occasionally a female version of this spirit a “Butzefrau” also exists but is less common. The Butzemann will take care of a farmers land, performing many chores and protecting against spirits of cold and rot, and receiving gifts of Molasses and Milk as thanks. Around Halloween the Butzemann's body will be burned and its spirit released to the Parade of the Dead led by Holle. There is a risk if the body is not burned that the Wild Hunt will claim the spirit, but leave the body open to more hostile or misanthropic spirits. Each generation of Butzemann receives the names of the previous creations with the first one being known as (Name) + der nei (Or “The new”) before becoming the surname or clan name of this specific series of Butzemann/Butzefrau (Name)+sen/docha. The spirits themselves are benevolent and typically more than a little friendly to those they serve as caretakers to, though their left over scarecrow bodies serve as easy physical manifestation for any number of spirits, akin to spiritual hermit crabs in a way.... Eyewitness Accounts 1) One well known account among the heathens of Urglaawe tribal tradition tells of “Delbel the Butzemann” who was built with a rickety leg, unclear if historical instance or if used as a warning against not following traditions regarding the physical body. The creator of Delbel died and the resulting chaos wrought carnage across the town, as his spirit was taken by “The White Lady” but his body was left unburnt, resulting in a Boogeyman who was more than happy to set fires, let loose numerous animals, and just cause general issues before a local Braucheri (Good Witch) aided Delbel in completing the latter half of his release. 2) Several instances of Butzemann burnings being described as “oddly beautiful” or dancing. I have yet to observe any moving scarecrows, though am not one to doubt regarding the Wild Hunt or Goblin like nature spirits. Conclusion: The Butzemann is a generally helpful borderline domesticated spirit, far more congenial than the more temperamental Brownie or Kobold. Requiring little more than physical upkeep and some minor gifts as thank you, it is unclear given its state of being a clothed scarecrow if it dislikes gifts of clothes similar to many domestic spirits. I am forced to conclude the Butzemann is a helpful spirit, though its form should be burned to avoid rampant arson from scarecrows, we get enough of that from the humans on Halloween.",2022-02-01 05:36:39+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/526,,,199,0,1,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2022-02-01 05:11:19,2022-02-01,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/7700,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.5480.user.AnAmericanSpirit.post.523,1518985858,AnAmericanSpirit,523,,"Bestiary Entry #34-The Groundhog Territory & Habitat: Pennsylvania and its various Groundhog Burrows primarily, actively venerated at versammlinge gatherings, power centers during the ancient holiday now known as “Groundhog Day” making Punxsutawney the focal point of the figures energy. Can be found across the USA and parts of Canada. The Groundhog is a spirit and totemic animal of the American tribe known commonly as the Pennsylvania Dutch or Deitsch. The traditions surrounding it and its related Holiday are old, and can be traced back to the Bear Cult of the Old Ones, and the festival of the little lights and rising flames. The Groundhog or “King Groundhog” is an odd spirit as by accounts we have uncovered he is an ancient being born in the Chaos of the Long Long Ago. Despite his legend being fairly new in many ways. Able to control the weather or at the least predict it. “The One True Prophet” as they call him. With even the world famous Punxsutawney Phil being but a pretender, his “Oracle of Delphi” if you will, the Groundhog fulfilling a role akin to Gaia Apollo. Mother Earth (Hertha? Gaia?) is described as bound in her chains and proclaiming that those in need of prophecy must “Seek the Groundhogs Hole”. It is said the Groundhog is embodied in all the Groundhogs, with all of them being both The Groundhog and not The Groundhog. The “Cult of Groundhogism” as it is called is practiced among the Deitsch. Some practice it as Tongue-in-Cheek, while others with far more seriousness. The various Inner Circles and their “priests” of The Groundhog Prophets are of high import in regards to this spirit. Eyewitness Accounts 1) The Groundhog is honored at various gatherings, in one instance an effigy of Punxsutawney Phil was hung for daring to be a pretender to the throne of The Groundhog. Implying some level of awareness that Phil is not the primary figure of this pagan cult. The men also tend to show their hands in front of them like paws when swearing oaths to a statue (often crowned in the same ceremony) of The Groundhog, as “Baby Groundhogs”. 2) A story told concerning the Groundhog and Mother Earth involves Mother Earth swearing that The Groundhog is the one true prophet, his association with an Elder God of the Old Ones, testifies to this figures age. 3) Groundhog Day is said to be the day that Butzemann (Protective rural spirits in Scarecrows) are built and blessed by witches, and is directly associated with the Goddess Holle. It is unclear the relationship between The Groundhog and Holle, but both have found ties to the Holiday. 4) Groundhogs Groundhog Day celebrations are powerful instances of tradition taking form, with the focal point around the various Groundhog Prophets, most notable figures such as General Beauregard in the South, as well as Punxsutawney Phil. Complete with numerous rituals and traditions, as well as an honor guard and keepers of his secrets. The speaking of Groundhogese has yet to be deciphered, though we are forced to conclude the scroll read off is pre-prepared if still powerful. Gobblers Knob possesses more power than it wishes to recognize, culminating in the Holiday's celebration. Much fun was had by all, and the Hot Cocoa was excellent. Conclusion: The Groundhog is an important and powerful spirit, related primarily to its core tribe the Deitsch. Most likely harmless, but stronger then first perceived, may require consideration as a deity rather than a spirit. The Cult of Groundhogism including tertiary members, numbers easily in the millions. Though as of yet has remained a non-threat and been allowed to stand despite clear cut heresy to the Church.",2022-01-31 06:35:55+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/523,,,212,0,4,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2022-01-31 05:49:43,2022-01-31,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/7690,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The moon-eyed people were said to be a race of people who lived in the southern Appalachians. They are very different in appearance from the Cherokee. The men had big bushy beards. Their skin was pure white and their hair was blonde or for some, almost as wide as their skin. It is believed they were unable to see during the day and they only came out at night. Their eyes were pale blue and glowed in the darkness. The most well known of the instructors is just near the NC border in Georgia. Fort Mountain, now a state park. Fort Mountain (pictured in the last slide) is a 850 ft long stone wall thought to have been constructed by the moon-eyed people for a battle between them and the Creek Nation, who felt the moon eyed people had no right to the land (some say it was actually the Cherokee who drove them out). The moon eyed people lost this battle and went to live in caves and underground. It is believed by many archaeologists that the moon-eyed people were actually European settlers who made contact with the Cherokee long before any others discovered this country.

It was a long and hard journey, but because of his determination, the land they treaded on, would soon become settled, and become what we now know as the state of Kentucky. Boone and his party, were the first frontiersman to settle beyond the borders of the 13 colonies. Today, you can walk through the Daniel Boone National Forest, and take the same paths that Boone, himself cleared. You can even find his initials on some of the trees. A fascinating and wonderful aspect of this land, is that the vast majority of the wilderness has been left untamed and unspoiled...just as Daniel Boone found it. Boone lived a long life (uncommon back then), and died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 85. I highly recommend reading more about him. Watch the movies, read the books.

Despite this Father Time is an entity within himself and often appears alongside other folkloric deities. Being depicted as a friend of the Grim Reaper and often using his scythe if he so chooses. He is also at times depicted with Santa Claus, implying a possible agreement regarding the Time Santa Claus uses to make his nighttime ride. The most notable however is the figure of Baby New Year (Identified by some as the Frankish god Lollus) who he often hands the dominion of the New Year over to when the year ends and he dies or retires. He is often depicted with a Scythe, Holly Wreathe, book, hourglass, and sometimes even wings. At the end of 2021 it is time for him to pass his Sash to Baby New Year and maybe go have drinks with Santa and Grim.

Promoting charities, visiting children in the hospital, leading parades, and more. Santa is not only a symbol of the Holiday he is a symbol of the goodwill, kindness, and hope embodied in the Yuletide. Those who portray him often grow their beards out specifically to do so, dyeing their beards white and wearing the common red suit.

Oftentimes comforting children on their deathbed, or helping the children who come to them with their list (including several instances of beating up abusive parents after the child revealed their secret to Santa). Many of them have even stated they understand they are embodying a deity, much as Wild Man mumming customs like Krampus runs and the Mari Lwyd embody deities, so do those portraying Santa.

This also functions as a rite of passage. As a young child must train the dog, taking responsibility for it often teaching it to hunt. Learning many life lessons.

This humble tradition is millennia old and has appeared in some form during Yuletide for as long as can be recorded. Many areas would leave out feasts for the dead, who would come to visit during Yuletide and consume the spirit of the food. Families would leave food out as offerings for a day sometimes a few and then consume it, as the spirits had had their fill at this point they would feast. Why Cookies? well this combines another common element of Yuletide traditions the creation of baked goods as offerings for deities and spirits. Such as the Sinterklaas Speculaas reminiscent of Fro or Wodan, or the Hot Cross buns made for Ostara. The combination of these two traditions resulted in the modern tradition of the leaving out of the offerings of both the special baked good and the food for the spirits (ancestors) in milk and cookies for a Jolly Old Elf.-TLK",2021-12-10 03:15:24+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/353,,,185,0,1,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2021-12-10 03:06:03,2021-12-10,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/6780,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They make the toys, prep his sleigh, and live and work in the North pole. These Christmas Elves in much the same vein as Tomte are in fact the memory of the Ancestral spirits of the dead. Appearing around Yuletide to deliver gifts to their living relatives. In Sardinia this is most blatant as in some areas the tradition of the dead collecting and delivering gifts is stated plainly. Unlike the workshop elves of Santa's North Pole, the ghosts of the Sardinian people rise from the dead and simply steal (borrow forever without asking) the gifts from stores and bring them to their descendants. In this vein Santa behaves much the same as Wotan, Harlequin, Holda, and King Arthur in leading a host of the dead. But instead of the ancient Battle Hosts and Hunts, instead they work in the North Pole a land of mystery where souls may wander.

With people who have physical oddities often being shown off to the amazement of those around them. Though this has resulted in abuse at times, it was actually often a way for them to pull themselves up and many were well spoken and educated. For our people it is actually a form of wonder, we are amazed that such people exist, often in real life fighting back the urge to ask them a myriad of questions, believing it to be rude. The Lion Faced man for instance spoke 5 languages and would often have conversations with his audience and retired in his 30's. In an odd way it reminds us of a physical manifestation of our spirits the Wildmen and Fey. A magical experience. With some interviews with modern members of freak shows realizing many people do not hate or feel disgust of them but are instead fascinated but worry they cannot approach, something they realized after joining. They are not hated but fascinating. -TLK",2021-10-27 12:34:55+00:00,https://t.me/AnAmericanSpirit/205,,,139,0,0,1,PeerChannel,1289595626.0,hyperboreanradio,2021-10-27 12:33:32,2021-10-27,https://t.me/hyperboreanradio/6153,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Others would have the ability to change size coming from a tiny opening in their place of burial and returning through the same small opening. Traditionally beheading, sticking a clove of garlic in its mouth, and staking the corpse to the coffin and maybe dismemberment and burning on top of it were used to kill a Vampire.

The tradition of carving them with pumpkins rather than Turnips is uniquely American, with it likely originating in folk customs from Celtic immigrants bringing traditions of Samhain to a new country. In 1866 the tradition of Pumpkin carving was mentioned as being practiced Enmasse in the city of Ontario, since it spread North from America this indicates it was much older and the tradition may even predate the formation of the USA. ""The old time custom of keeping up Hallowe'en was not forgotten last night by the youngsters of the city.

He roamed across the wilds planting Apple Trees (mostly Cider) earning him the nickname The American Dionysus. Johnny would've been fierce to behold, a shaggy beard and wooly body of immense strength, wise piercing eyes staring out from below his shaggy hair and tin pot hat. He communed with spirits and did superhuman feats such as walking across flame and ice barefoot. He was said to have a spirit bride and be a friend to the animals with a wolf as companion. His Holidays are around the two Equinoxes which coincide with his birth and death. He effectively fulfills a Hermit Wildman/Green Man Archetype within American Folklore.

However, aside from the usual legends of flying over cars and scaring a passerby the Mothman is also connected to the deaths of 46 people as he was spotted and connected to the Silver Bridge Collapse in 1967.

He hung on the World Tree to win the runes - those keys to the mysteries of the universe. He stole the Mead of Inspiration, another tool for seizing higher consciousness, from the giant Suttung. In the tales of the Norsemen and the Germanic tribes, he is a wanderer, an explorer, dedicated to Becoming. He is no relic from a bygone age, he is as up to date as tomorrow's headlines. We at Wotan Network do not live in the Migration Age, or the Viking Age...Like you, we live in the Twenty-First Century. It is no surprise that the Folk who bear Wotan in their very genes led the way to space. It was Robert Goddard, an American of British descent who created the liquid-fueled rocket. The American Rocket Society and its counterparts in Britain and Germany were likewise on the leading edge of rocket science. Men like Wernher von Braun, Willy Ley, Herman Oberth, and others made space travel possible. This is not an accident. We are the sons and daughters of Wotan - a Faustian race, always seeking, striving, and exploring. In the roar of the rocket headed for space, we hear the voice of Wotan. He is in the heart and soul of his Folk. Wotan, be with us in our outward reach!...Our descendants will dance among the stars.

I was an ROTC student in college, and fiercely anti-communist (and I still am today). Vietnam was underway, and Americans were dying. From the first time I heard ""Ballad of the Green Berets"" on the radio, I knew that I wanted to join Special Forces and serve my country. In 1972 I went through Infantry Officer Basic, earned my paratrooper wings and my Ranger tab. Gung ho! By then I was a fervent follower of Odin; ready to take whatever my Wyrd gave me! Lucky for me, the Army had better judgement, and sent me to Germany...Probably saved my life. Time has passed, and I have mellowed. Most of America's foreign adventures since then have been futile or at least unnecessary, and too many good men (and women; think ""Afghanistan evacuation"") have died. The arms corporations get rich, the politicians get their cut, and on it goes. As for me, I serve my Folk, and He who is Wotan, Odin, Wodhanaz. And I will serve my country, when it is just. But Israel can go to hell. First of all, they are not my Folk, and second, they are the murderers who tried to sink the USS Liberty some years back (https://ussliberty.org/). Americans died because of them. And if we commit troops to the current atrocity, still more will die - ultimately, because of Israel.

The rest, as they say, is history. Today we are witnessing another trigger which may result in Wotan's intervention: a rising tide of non-European migration into Europe and, yes, America.

I recently posted about the rune-toss that sent me on one journey, then running into a friend in SFO on my way out of country, encountering a man wearing a Thor's hammer necklace in the jungle of Myanmar, and such. (You can find all these in my previous posts, if you like.) I gave my opinion that the Gods ""speak"" to us today by what Carl Jung would call ""meaningful coincidences."" There is one more such occurrence that I have not related...It was 1976, and I was on my way to Johannesburg, in South Africa...by way of hitchhiking across the Sahara, and beyond. It was an amazing trip, and I was well into Niger when I decided to fly to a country closer to my destination. (The name of the country has changed; there were a lot of ""people's republics"" on the African map at that time.) Unfortunately, after takeoff I recalled that I did not have a visa for the country in which we were landing...and if I was searched, officials would find my loose-leaf visa for the Republic of South Africa. I recalled that a young Englishman had been pulled off a plane and shot when he was caught carrying South African military gear...This wasn't looking good. We arrived at our destination. I decided to play the ""burned out hippy"" - ""Dude, I thought this was Marakkesh!"" - if necessary. But I was sweating it. I got off the plane. Fifty feet away was a not-very-nice looking fellow with an AK over his shoulder. He was meticulously examining each person's papers. There was no way to avoid this; this was looking bad. The guard examined the papers of the man in front of me...handed them back to the fellow...and took the papers from the man behind me. He was literally two feet from me, and ignored me! No eye contact, nothing. I did not correct his error - I grabbed my rucksack and got the hell out of the place as quickly as I could. For a precious moment, I had been effectively invisible.

On a train ride? Disneyland? In the Vatican? Here's a story for you... Years ago, when I was freelancing for Soldier of Fortune magazine, I ended up in Myanmar (formerly known as Burma). I was there for two reasons - to recover some personal effects of an American who had been killed by mortar fire, and to write an article for SOF about the war. Actually, I had a third reason; the good guys (Karen National Liberation Army) were, among other things, against the Chinese influence in the region...and I have a sort of personal vendetta against China. (I still do: that's a story for another time.) Unfortunately, it was the middle of the monsoon, and unlike the American Army the KNLA were only minimally active in inclement weather. I was sitting in HQ one soggy, muddy day, hoping to get on with my mission...when a man with a fancier-than-usual rifle staggered into the tent. And he sure as hell was not a local - definitely a White man, the only one I had seen since crossing the border. It turned out he was a German national who, on vacation from his job back in Deutschland, paid his own way to Myanmar and trained the KNLA soldiers in the art of sniping. A conversation was inevitable. After a couple of minutes the German said to me, ""What's that piece of metal around your neck?"" My Thor's hammer had, partially, slipped out between the buttons on my shirt. I pulled it into full view and explained what it was....At which point, the German reached into HIS shirt, and pulled his own Mjolnir into view.

Then, surprisingly, I heard a familiar voice call out ""Hey, Steve!"" Sure enough, it was my friend, Fred, known among us casually as ""Fred the merc."" Fred was a Californian who had served in the US Army, then later in the South African Defense Force. Like me, Fred was a follower of Wotan/Odin. This time, he told me, he was on the way to join the Tomislav Brigade in Bosnia. The chance of our meeting on the way to our separate war zones, in that crowded and unlikely place, among thousands of strangers and in a very narrow slice of time, must have been - like the very improbable throw of runes described in my last post - literally one in millions. Weeks later, after my journey to Africa failed to give me what I needed, I got on the plane in Jo'berg with a ticket for California. On that long, long flight from Johannesburg to Amsterdam, I realized I wasn't through...I got off the plane in A'dam and got on a train heading for Croatia, then Bosnia. The stunned look on Fred's face when he saw me was worth the ticket. My time as a guest of the Tomislav Brigade is a long story for another time. Wotan...the runes (the mythic gifts of Wotan/Odin)...and finally the encounter with Fred, a warrior and fellow adherent to the Odinic/Wotanic faith...all wrapped up in a tidy bundle. For me, this means that 1. Wotan, however you picture him, is a real force/personality/god, and 2. He can speak to us through what we think of as Jung's ""meaningful coincidences"" and 3. Wotan is much more than a myth or legend; he is a powerful spiritual asset for our Folk.

In this post, as in the previous one, I will explain why I disagree. In my previous post, Why Wotan, I stated that whenever I encounter amazing coincidences involving Wotan, I need to consider that he is trying to tell me something. ""Coincidences"" (Jungian ""synchronicities"") are simply the manner by which Wotan speaks to the soul of those who follow him. I promised my readers that I would relate one or more such occurrences, and I will fulfill this promise in a few moments. Quite some years ago, I was a freelance writer for a popular military magazine. (Anyone out there remember Soldier of Fortune?) I decided to go to South Africa and, from there, to make contact with the anti-communist forces under Jonas Savimbi, in Angola. I decided to query the Elder Futhark runes on the issue. The twenty-four runes were put in a leather bag, carefully randomized, and had no tactile clues. I pulled out a rune called ""Perthro."" The next day, I tried it again, with all the usual precautions - and drew the same rune. The day after, I repeated the procedure and - you guessed it! - got ""Perthro"" again. By the way, Perthro translates as ""dice cup,"" which makes it all weirder still! The odds of my drawing Perthro three times is one in 24, times 24, times 24, or one chance in 1,382,400. My point here is that runes are powerful, and Odin/Wotan is an actual force or, better yet, a personality. (And, you'll be glad to know, he's on our side...We are his Folk, and he is Folk-father.) Odin or Wotan, of course, is the God of the Runes...and he was giving me a puzzle, a challenge. I felt He was telling me to take the risk, that it would serve a good end and in some way and to some extent aid our Folk. Or maybe he just thought I would learn something from the experience. I started arranging my trip to South Africa. Next post: There I was, in San Francisco International, a ticket to Jo'berg in my hand, when...

We summon his might and wisdom for the purpose of preserving the existence and well-being of our Folk around the world. We intend to maintain our culture, our heritage, and the existence of our people down through the ages. We stand in opposition to wokeism and multiculturalism. We recognize the similar rights of other groups to look after their own interests, as well ...Indeed, they're doing a much better job of that than we are. You may say, ""There is no Wotan. He's just a myth."" But Carl Jung, who was both psychologist and mystic, disagreed. He began by thinking in terms of ""the Wotan archetype"" and later, according to his friend, the writer Miguel Serrano, accepted Wotan as an actual, if mysterious, personality. Those of us who follow Wotan, under any of his names, accept him as a conscious force or personality. Others think of him as a Jungian archetype. I won't be offended if you want to think about him that way - and I don't imagine Wotan cares, either. He's got more important things to do and so do we. As for me, I am convinced of his real, if mysterious existence and I treat him with respect. When great ""coincidences"" - Jung would call them ""synchronicities"" - run through my life, I know I am on the right track, and that Wotan and/or my Ancestors approve of what I am doing. I will describe some of those ""coincidences"" in coming posts. When it comes down to the bottom line - whether you are a skeptic or a believer - your participation in our endeavor is welcome - by me, by the Wotan Network staff, and certainly by Wotan. Read my book, The Spear...tell others about us...repost our material to your friends. Resist the degeneracy around you. By our work and will, love and ""luck,"" we are determined to save our Folk.

On this date - June 8th - in 1967, the USS Liberty was attacked in international waters by fighter aircraft and torpedo boats belonging to the Israeli government. Thirty-four American sailors were killed and 171 others wounded. Israeli explanations were, to say the least, inadequate. The Liberty was an intelligence collecting vessel monitoring activity in the area. The American flag was properly flown, and the attack was preceded by more than six hours of intense low-level surveillance by Israeli photo reconnaissance aircraft, which buzzed the ship as low as 200 feet directly overhead. This was not a case of mistaken identity. The Israelis jammed radio frequencies in an apparent attempt to hide what they were doing, and they made every possible attempt to sink the vessel. Motivation? Presumably, they were up to something they didn't want Uncle Sam to know about; speculations vary. American politicians covered for them...as usual. Read the full account here: https://www.usslibertyveterans.org/statement_of_purpose.html American and Israeli politicians alike have lied about this event for decades.

Brave men on both sides fought and died in that battle, and many others were maimed for life, because that's what happens in wars. I salute them, all of them; the average German soldier was just a man like any other and both our countries were poorer when all was said and done. I spent several years in Germany, courtesy of Uncle Sam. I was able to qualify on the current German weapons, and I earned their parachutist wings by jumping with German airborne troopers. Perhaps best of all, I participated in an exercise in which American Special Forces jumped in to simulate guerrillas fighting against an invading Soviet foe. In the course of three years or so I met a lot of men who served in the German army during World War Two; surprise! They were human, just like the rest of us! The man who owned our favorite restaurant was a kindly old man who had walked to Moscow and back. Please, no more ""brother wars."" It is sad to see that America, and the West generally, has to some extent wasted its potential. Yes, we had some glory years but our culture now is degenerate, our currency out of favor, wokeness and weakness prevail, and ""our best allies"" in the Middle East are genocidal maniacs. (They also try to sink American ships. The Israeli attack on the USS Liberty killed 34 American sailors and wounded 173 on June 8, 1967. An accident? Ask the men who were there...Source: USS Liberty Veterans Organization, https://www,usslibertyveterans.org). We have huge tasks before us. Perhaps ironically, an answer lies in the primordial wisdom and power of Wotan - he who was known as Woden by the Saxons, or Odin by the Norse. He is the Father of our Folk, our beacon of wisdom, our inspiration to greatness. We have trusted alien faiths out of the Middle East for too long.

What's it got to do with the real world? How can it help us meet the crisis facing men and women of European heritage today?"" Here's my answer: We are the only group on Earth, aside from various tribal peoples in the hinterland, who are required to turn our backs on our ancestors and our accomplishments. Instead, we are obliged to be ""woke"" - to reject our history. our heritage, and the forebears that gave us life. If we refute our forebears, we surrender our souls to the masses and the machines. Such a surrender is not acceptable. It is poisonous and ultimately genocidal. We must not, under any circumstances whatsoever, comply with the cultural shaming and distortions aimed at us by the press and media. Instead, we need to adopt ""The Wotan Formula"": Spirituality shapes culture, culture shapes politics, and politics determines our fate. Our SPIRITUALITY emphasizes love of ancestors and our Folk and the values of honor, loyalty, tradition, and family. Ours is a heroic ethos, with deep roots in the history of Europe, and which demands fairness to all who meet us with open hand and heart. These values determine the shape of our native and natural CULTURE. Our culture in turn determines our POLITICS - the laws and governance of the society in which we live. Want to change the world? Start with our native spirituality, those truths that are carved in our very DNA, and work your way outwards. Our ancestors live in us - do them honor.

Three times per week - Monday, Wednesday, and Friday - just is not realistic for me. I'm cutting back to perhaps two posts a week simply because I am overwhelmed. In addition to the posts I have been making on Gab, MeWe, VK, Telegram, and X, I am preparing to revive my YouTube channel (and perhaps add a Rumble version). I will still be posting here regularly to keep you updated on my work, however. In addition to the videos, there is another, very important, project that commands more of my time - a book to be titled The Way of the Cauldrons. In Norse lore, there are two major quests by which Odin acquires wisdom - hanging on the World Tree to win the mysteries of the runes, and his theft of the Mead of Inspiration, which also imparts great knowledge and power. Everybody knows something about runes, but fewer are familiar with the story of the mead. And right now, we - our Folk! - need every spiritual tool at our disposal, every ounce of wisdom, that we can muster. My new book is, so far as I know, the only one anywhere which analyzes Odin's mead quest as a path of personal evolution, by which we together may lift up our Folk and ensure our high Destiny. Wotan Network will still be as active as before; I have stalwart friends helping me bear that load. In summary - you will still be hearing from me every week, as my schedule permits. And I will be keeping you updated on my videos, progress on the Way of the Cauldrons, and various observations of the world around us! Hail to the High One! Hail to our Folk, now and forever! P.S.

You can find Lulu's store online at https://lulu.com/shop. But there's more! The Spear, as well as my groundbreaking Asatru: A Native European Spirituality and several of my shorter works, are on EBay. However, they're not being given a lot of prominence - but if you do a search on them and take a look, their algorithm will give these works more attention (even if you don't end up making a purchase). UPDATE: I had hoped to have a YouTube post done by today, but I'm still struggling with some of the technical aspects. It's been a while since I created a video...Like, a year or more! Tomorrow should be better. In the meantime, check out the items described above! P.S. I post to all my media outlets on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. If there are schedule disruptions, I will still aim for three posts a week. P.P.S. The Spear - the ""field manual"" for Wotan Network - may also be ordered from our store at wotannetwork.com.

I'm stressed, or distracted, or bored...I drive down to the bottom of the hill on which I live, and park the car. I note the time, and get out of the vehicle. I start walking. Yes, these are paved roads, and homes are dotted here and there, but mostly what I see are trees - short ones, tall ones, oaks, pines. Some are mossy, some are not. Usually I see some deer, and of course the ubiquitous squirrels. Two horses are in a corral; sometimes they come over to see me but mostly they are just doing horse stuff. And then it hits me. My stress is gone. I am surrounded by beauty. I am filled with joy. I look at the blue sky and the puffy clouds, and it dawns on me: Within the field of my vision, there is (probably) more organic life than on all the other planets in our Solar System, combined. And then, unfailingly, I realize just how unspeakably beautiful it all is...and a sense of the holy, the transcendent, fills my consciousness. I am deeply, unspeakably, grateful. ""Thank you for this day of life"", I say aloud, and a line from a story written by Robert Heinlein (""The dean of science fiction writers"") crosses my mind and escapes my lips, words set in a poem for a spacefaring future...""We pray for one last landing on the globe that gave us birth...Let us rest our eyes on the fleecy skies, and the cool green hills of Earth..."" Nature. Beauty. Awareness and inspiration. Some who seek the higher realms of being - Jane Dixon, author of Biology of Kundalini: Exploring the Fire of Life, for example - points out that our environment, and especially nature, and beauty, and all which stirs the human soul, is an important factor in producing a deep and lasting spiritual experience. I think she is right....Hail Wotan, and hail our Awakening! P.S. I post to all my media outlets on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

Yuletide is, and always has been, the holy season of the Scandinavians and their Germanic cousins everywhere. It is a time loaded with spiritual might, if only we have the insight and the understanding to penetrate the Christian overlay. As this season draws to a close, it behooves us to embrace again the wisdom and strength of our Teutonic forebears, and to carry this spiritual inheritance into the days and months beyond. Hopefully you have observed these holy days and nights, hailed the Holy Powers, embraced your Folk literally and metaphorically, and opened yourself to the Gods and Goddesses,making the holidays into, truly, ""holy-days."" (It's not too late!) We - all of us - need to become more than we are. We must grow wiser and stronger, braver and bolder, more in love with our Folk and in love with the high Destiny that is ours, if only we have the will to grasp it! How will you be stronger? What will you do to earn high repute and folk-fame in the year to come? These are not rhetorical questions. Sit down and make your personal list today. How will you, metaphorically, ""throw the Spear"" of Awakening and of Wisdom over our Folk? How will you serve Wotan and his Way? This goes beyond ""New Year's resolutions"" - it should be your steadfast determination in the year to come...Grasp your greatness! Let's get going! We have a world to change!

Some of this is obvious: Remembering ancestors, strengthening family bonds, exercising the traits of generosity and love, all these are valuable. Taking the ""bah, humbug"" approach is a sure sign of spiritual regression - and what a waste of opportunities! You probably don't need to be lectured on that. But how about taking it to a new level this year? The deep nature of things is different around the solstice-tide; it's not as simple as space and time, or darkness and light, or snow and chill - though all of these are factors. We have responded on a deep level to this time of year throughout much of our evolution, especially in the northern climes. Open yourself to that deeper connection - the connection to all those ancestors who touch us still. Sense the love, the hope, the striving. Become more than you are...and our Folk, past and present and future, in our time-transcending essence. becomes more. Bask in the wonder of it all.

The leftists have been very effective in wielding this weapon...but anything they can do, we can do better! In this strategy, an ""oppressed"" tribal or ethnic groups can use the features of its culture as weapons - things like spirituality, history, art, songs, mythology, folkways, and customs. All these can bolster the morale and pride of the group, giving its members a sense of unity and the will to resist erosion and absorption. Our folk can use these methods as well as anyone else. The wisdom tales (""myths"") of our Folk, our spirituality, our history, our food and music and language, our symbols - all these are means to resist absorption. Anyone reading this should have no problem listing such cultural items and aggressively promoting them. Consider one of my favorite sayings: ""Spirituality shapes culture...Culture shapes politics."" By creating our own ""culture of resistance"" against degeneracy, cancel culture, and the anti-White (concealed as ""anti-racist"") efforts of our foes, we can make changes. Difficult? Not at all. Folk songs, poems, movies, cultural events like Highland games and Oktoberfest celebrations, the use of runes either alone or as part of an inscription, the display of symbols such as Thor's hammer, monthly Odin World Prayer Day - the list is endless. And it's fun. But don't settle for this! This is just the beginning! There's a lot more you can and should do...For more ideas on resistance, see Chapter Four in The Spear.

I took mead, my Gungnir pendant and knotwork ring, and my unopened copy of The Spear I'd been saving for this occasion. I found a small spear-like grove of white trees up away from the tourists (I actually felt Odin had picked it out) and as twilight began to set I offered the mead. As the night descended I opened my new copy of The Spear with just enough light to see Stephen McNallen's signature, and as I took up my Gungnir pendant that was lying next to the book I noticed something - the good megen connected with Stephen's signature was uber-strong. I felt honoured to have been able to sense and experience this.

It is one of our most vital acts of spiritual resistance against the Age of Ultimate Degeneracy. But for those who want to push the limits just a bit more, there is now a new challenge... Let me introduce...""Wotan on the Drop Zone."" A drop zone - sometimes shortened to ""DZ"" - is a field where parachutists land after jumping out of planes. Yesterday, to celebrate my 75th birthday, I did what is perhaps the first-ever ""Wotan on the Drop Zone"". Sheila and I, by prior arrangement, drove to a nearby skydiving facility, got our briefing, and connected with the experienced parachutists with whom I was going to make my tandem jump. I got my training session with a no-nonsense expert wearing a ""Five Finger Death Punch"" tee shirt - I knew right away I was going to like this guy - who put me through the procedure. This jump was considerably more complicated than my previous tandems, where I was basically just strapped along for the ride. This instructor had higher expectations: Not only was I directed to go into the usual arch and assume a good position, I had to observe the altimeter on my wrist and deploy the chute at five thousand feet. Finding the rip cord - which was on the instructor, not me - had to be done by feel, reaching behind me - which made it a little more complicated, but I executed it perfectly. The ride down was ecstatic. The roar in my ears sounded like an explosion that never ended. The adrenaline was pumping like crazy. I spoke my words to Wotan, in English and in German, and just went with the high. The landing was easier than I expected. After dropping gear, Sheila and I took a horn and a growler of mead off to one side, and shared a horn of mead with the High One. I would have included my jumpmaster as well, but he was already gearing up for another jump. Hail Wotan, God of our Ancestors, God of our Folk! May our love and devotion awaken our sleeping brothers and sisters!",2023-10-17 00:48:47+00:00,https://t.me/Stephen_A_McNallen/398,,,1781,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaWebPage,1,http://t.me/Stephen_A_McNallen,t.me,Stephen A.

I have been familiar with the Elder Futhark, Younger Futhark, and Anglo-Saxon Futhorc for literally decades. What I had NOT run across was a text on the Gothic runes. Well, now I have, and it is amazing. It's available through Lulu. Ten chapters, 260 pages, on topics including the history of the Goths (and theories of their origin), a breakdown of each individual rune and its meaning in Gothic, an original rune-poem by the author for each of the twenty-four runes, plus commentary, maps, and photographs - the works. Maes finishes up with an extensive list of sources for those who want to know more. Gothic Runes is an electronic book (PDF), designed to print as an attractive paper volume for those who wish to do so. A visit to Fritz Maes' Lulu page reveals a fascinating list of other works by the author: Germanic Chivalry, which is mostly about fighting arts, Ringen, covering medieval German wrestling, and Princely Singers of Eros, about the composers of erotic love ballads during the Middle Ages.

But I had an earlier exposure to Him, which I had all but forgotten for a very long time. You'll laugh, but here it is: My dad used to go down to a local store and buy his cigars - El Producto Favoritos. Sometimes he took me with him, and he would let me buy a comic book -even though they cost a whole dime back in those days. (We're talking my age being maybe eight to ten years old, so this was about 1956 or 1958.) Donald Duck was a favorite. Now, these comic books could actually be educational. In one episode, the Ducks set off to find the Philosopher's Stone. In another, they engaged the Minotaur. I am sure there were other such classic adventures, but another one, which I was to remember many years later, had the Duck family in Norway. Deep inside a cave, they encountered Odin and Thor, and perhaps others. But the Gods were mere shapes, mere shadows of themselves, ghostly. Why? When asked, they responded that it was because no one believed in them anymore. I don't remember anything else about the story. Did it make me interested in Norse mythology? No. Did it have any part in the Awakening? Not really. I pretty much forgot about it. It was not a cause of the Awakening... but somehow, it was a forerunner.

The last chapter summarizes the symbolic ""taking up Wotan's Spear"" by personal transformation and cultural/political activity. The only problem - the common rune-rows do not have a rune meaning, specifically, ""spear."" I had to look beyond the runic ""alphabets"" with which I usually work...and finally, I found it! A later addition to the Anglo-Saxon rune row was, indeed, ""Gar,"" or ""spear."" But unlike the earlier runes, it had no verse attached to it...So I wrote one, using the basic structure of the Anglo-Saxon verses. Here it is: The noble ones take up the spear Not iron and ash, but wit and will. Their folk to save, great fame to win. The athelings grips the gar, Fling it far over the foe And write the runes to reshape the world. - S. McNallen Wotan, Be With Us!

As the report describes, the federal regulators are using the same regulatory tools and pressure tactics that they used during the notorious ""Operation Choke Point"": the Obama administration's effort to use informal regulatory pressure and backroom threats to cut off payday lenders, gun and tobacco dealers, and other politically unpopular businesses from the modern financial system. Just like during Operation Choke Point, the banking agencies have now put out informal guidance documents tarring cryptocurrency customers as posing a supposedly heightened risk to banks. Businesses in the cryptocurrency industry are suddenly finding themselves debanked, and stripped of access to the ACH network, without explanation. And in the past few weeks, federal regulators effectively shut down a bank that was known to be serving the crypto industry—and then chose to shutter rather than sell the part of the bank that serves digital asset customers, at a cost of billions of dollars.

Here are the results: Twenty years ago, 70 percent of Americans described themselves as patriots; today that has dropped to 38 percent.Those who thought religion was important fell from 62 percent to 39 percent.The percent of those to whom having children was important went from 59 percent to 30 percent.Americans who thought community involvement was important went from 62 percent to 27 percent.Those who thought having a lot of money was important increased from 31percent to 43 percent. I am somewhat ambivalent about some of these points - but it is clear that America has changed a lot, mostly for the worse. We are afflicted by a cultural malaise - Spengler's ""decline of the West."" Two things in particular stand out: (1) When it comes to valuing children, we know that White folks are indeed being replaced, not just in America, but worldwide. (2) The declining interest in community involvement is a clear sign of our inward-turnng, our preoccupation with the cell phone, social media, and the internet generally. I address both of these problems, and others, in my soon-to-be-published book, The Spear. We must create a new culture, a culture that favors our people, a culture of resistance against the Borg, against the media-mind, against cybernetic domination. A return to our spiritual roots is the answer...But our salvation does not lie in the faiths of the Middle East.

Here is what I sent: A MESSAGE FROM AMERICA ON THIS DAY OF SADNESS From 1973 to 1976 I had the privilege of serving as a young American Infantry officer, stationed in Germany. During those years, I spent most of my weekends traveling around the country, walking literally hundreds of miles on back roads and in small towns. I also participated in programs with the German military, earning its paratrooper wings and taking part in other exercises with German soldiers. I stayed with German families for days at a time, and I came to love Germany and the German people. I remember the day our Infantry battalion made a reconnaissance of the front lines we would defend if the Soviet tanks ever came pouring through the Fulda Gap. I looked at the hills before me, and thought of the horrors of war - and I was determined to do my best, if war came, to defend Germany. The Russians never came, but now I must defend Germany in another way - by speaking of the needless horror inflicted on Dresden by those who hated Her. When I think of the many thousands of ordinary men, women, and children - ordinary, helpless civilians - incinerated and suffocated in the bombing raids we remember today, my heart breaks. I will remember them this day and light a candle...a flame of love and remembrance, not the fire of hatred and death. All soldiers understand that people die in war. We also understand that the innocent die, not just soldiers. But the bombing of Dresden was different; it was a war crime. I am not the only one who thinks so; a highly decorated British pilot named Victor Gregg, who was a prisoner of war in Dresden and witnessed the horror, calls it what it was - murder. You can find his testimony online. Were there valuable industrial targets in Dresden? Yes. Was it necessary to kill many thousands of innocent civilians to hit those targets? No. The decision to bomb civilian targets and “displace” German industrial workers was made by the British Bomber Command, approved by Churchill in 1942. They were “displaced” indeed - their ashes drifted on the winds. This was an act of pure hatred.. No more brother wars! Hail to the fallen! Let us honor their memory, and grieve.

However, the video suggests that Jung believed the collective unconscious to be the same for everyone, regardless of racial background. This is erroneous; the great psychologist clearly stated that the content of the unconscious varied from race to race. I'm not trying to make a value judgement when I point this out, but the fact remains - human groups are not ""all the same under the skin""...and that's okay.

And is there such a thing as genetic memory? These ideas have been explored in video games and films like Assassin’s Creed. But it’s not a new idea. It can be traced to psychologist Carl Jung’s concept of the collective unconscious. Our traditional understanding is that memories are formed through networks of neurons in the brain. But researchers are discovering a new kind of memory that’s stored within the nucleus of neurons, deep within our DNA. Carl Jung’s work builds on the work of his one-time friend, colleague, and fellow psychologist Sigmund Freud, who posited that we have a conscious mind (which is made up of all the things we’re aware of, including the ego) and an unconscious mind, with is a repository of repressed desires, thoughts and memories. Freud hoped that Jung would be his successor and carry on his work, but this would never come to pass. Their disagreements grew as Jung made this own development and took his own direction in psychology, which diverged sharply from Freud’s. One of their major disagreements, was Jung’s concept of the collective unconscious, a kind of universal human memory that’s imprinted in the psyche; a storehouse of symbols and imagery that’s independent of time and space. We can think of it as a kind of universal ancestral memory, and we inherit the collective unconscious from our ancient ancestors, and it’s common to every person and every culture in the world. It’s the part of the mind that we all have available to us, and we can all tap into. Jung maintained that the collective unconscious was made up of psychic structures that are universal, that form all the elements of human experience, and are expressed as reoccurring patterns that shape our lives. He called these patterns archetypes. Examples of archetypes include the great mother. The wise old man. And the trickster. We see versions of these archetypes in every culture in the world. Other archetypes include the persona, and the shadow. Perhaps the most powerful archetype in Jung’s approach are numbers. Jung came to believe that the numbers 1 to 9 were some of the potent archetypal symbols of the psyche, and were the most basic and universal symbols we have. Jung once wrote that “number and synchronicity were always brought into connection with one another, both possess numinosity and mystery as their common characteristics, and all numbers from 1 to 9 are sacred.” Jung believed that everything is connected. That there’s an underlying unified reality from which everything emerges and to which everything returns. He called this idea Unus Mundus. This bears a striking similarity to the ancient Chinese concept of Qi, which is the vital energy that flows through all things.

Part of me misses this stuff, part of me doesn't...But, no regrets! December, 1993 - Somewhere over the African continent… The flight from Johannesburg to Amsterdam must be the longest one in the world. I sped through the thin air at thirty thousand feet, a drink in my hand and a pillow under my head. Far below me lay the sweltering heat and the human misery of the country I’d just spent three weeks trying to get into - Angola. My goal had been to link up with the rebel UNITA forces fighting for control of the country and interview their charismatic leader, Jonas Savimbi. At the least, the interview would have helped me pay off the credit card debt I had incurred by jaunting all over southern Africa. Better yet, I might have ended up on Savimbi’s payroll. Alas, it had all come to naught. I had flown to Katima Mulilo - scene of furious fighting between the South African army and Cubans years before. From there, I had ridden in the back of a truck to the tiny town of Bagani where I missed my UNITA contact by seconds. I spent the next three weeks trying to reestablish link-up, but luck was not with me. On the last possible day I could catch my plane back to the United States, I flew out of Johannesburg for Europe. Another day’s travel, and I would be arriving in San Francisco. But you know, the thought that I had not succeeded in getting into Angola really irked me.

I had come all the way from the USA to see if I could be of help, even if the only aid I could give was to write an article for SOF magazine. The monsoon was on full force and fighting had pretty well bogged down to zero, there was nowhere to go and not much to do. I was hanging out to see if any operations were pending, when in stumbled another White man - the first I had seen in weeks! - soaked, carrying his rifle. We introduced ourselves; it turned out he was from Germany, a physical therapist who on his vacations came to Myanmar to teach sniping. Small talk ensued. At one point i saw he was staring at my chest - I looked down, to see that my Thor's hammer had slipped out of my shirt. He looked at me and, wordless, reached into his shirt and pulled out his own.

In a sea of camouflaged red, yellow, orange and brown leaves I spotted a sprig of green oak leaves. There were 5 leaves.

Politically...well, let's just say that he was as dialed on the racial issue as anyone you will ever meet. But as a practitioner of yoga, he was a vegetarian. And trust me, up to the day he died...if it had been Right Action (as the yogis call it) or the principle behind the rune Raido (as we would call it)...He would not have hesitated to have terminated someone and hidden the body in a mineshaft.

msg_iteration.444.user.Stephen_A_McNallen.post.68,1540956866,Stephen_A_McNallen,68,,"LIFE, STRUGGLE - AND JOY! Many years ago, someone - it may have been my Shorin-Ryu sensei - said that ""Life is kumite"" - that is, combat. In my mind, that conjures an image of someone blocking, striking, and kicking against multiple opponents from different directions - someone constantly alert, clear-headed, and responsive. That image has never left me - and as the years go by, it seems more and more relevant. ""Kumite"" sounds a lot like ""multitasking."" It sounds better in German - ""Das Leben ist Kampf."" Sometimes, for all of us fighting for the existence and well-being of our people, the odds seem to be stacked against us. We have not yet learned to love ourselves, to value that wondrous thing that we are, and to work for our high Destiny. But we are rousing from our slumber, albeit gradually. As we learn to love our ancestors, and to value the inheritance - cultural, biological, historical - that they left us, our Awakening will accelerate. Learn to love the struggle! If we do it right, it earns us satisfaction, even a sense of inner joy! And as Herr Nietsche noted in his famous quote, it makes us stronger. At the end of the road lies victory. ..Or as Jost Turner wrote in a song, ""Fight your battles and dare the odds, drink your mead and praise the Gods..."" What have you done for our Folk today? For the memory of our ancestors? For the honor of our Gods and Goddesses? For the future existence and well-being of our people?

The typical follower of the Germanic Way has plenty of good qualities – intellectual curiosity, the boldness to take a different path, and, we can suppose, dedication to a tough code of conduct. Sometimes, being human, we do not live up to the best within us. Our nobility slips, we take the easy way out, and those character defects within each of us become all too obvious. It’s at times like this we need to ask ourselves just how much we are a credit to our ancestors, and to the Holy Powers.

A quick search revealed that this was the anniversary of the Battle of Stamford Bridge, fought on this day in 1066 between King Harold Godwinson of England, and Harald of Norway. I always remember this battle because of the bravery of one man, a Norwegian whose name has not come down to us but who, I am sure, was remembered by Odin and his valkyries. The unnamed hero was a man wielding a broad axe, standing atop a wooden bridge in northern England. He was the only fighter blocking the advance of the English troops as the Norwegians hastily assembled their shield wall. Ultimately it was to no avail; an Englishman managed to spear the axeman from below. The Norwegians lost the battle and their dreams of conquest died with the axe-wielding warrior.

Her husband unexpectedly and tragically passed away recently and our wonderful art community has come together and donated exquisite pieces to raise money for J and her young son. The auction is now live. There will be five items in each round. Bidding lasts 2 days. There will be one off day in between rounds for me to finalize transactions. There are tons of exquisite donations so stick around for a spell! This is a unique and fantastic opportunity to snag handcrafted artisan goods made by our Folk for the holidays or for yourself - and for such a wonderful cause. The gratitude in my heart for all the help and art donations I’ve received is tremendous. Thank y’all so much.

Art and graphic design have always been my passion, but lately, due to the state of Canada, guys like me can't find work anymore. It's been a rough few months, but I'm finally ready to roll the dice on myself. Please consider visiting my online ship and supporting the channel with likes, favorites, and maybe help a brother out and grab some channel merch. This would really help me and my family out.
