Victor - celebrated on May 8 - was a soldier stationed in Milan at the time of Emperor Maximian, punished for not having renounced his Christian faith. The chapel - probably built between the mid-fifth and sixth century AD - was aimed at preserving and celebrating the relics of the martyr, associated with those of Satyrus, brother of Ambrose, who died in 375 or 378 AD. The vault of the chapel is entirely in gold mosaic. The splendid mosaic decoration is one of the few surviving testimonies of an art that was to frequently embellish the great Milanese basilicas. The vault still shines today with the golden tiles that form the background of the portrait of Victor, framed by a ribbon with a large ruby and the fruits of the four seasons which symbolize the solar year.

msg_iteration.10366.user.ThirstForBeauty.post.6670,1561395949,ThirstForBeauty,6670,,"Georges de La Tour (13 March 1593 – 30 January 1652) was a French Baroque painter, who spent most of his working life in the Duchy of Lorraine, which was temporarily absorbed into France between 1641 and 1648. He painted mostly religious chiaroscuro scenes lit by candlelight. La Tour is best known for the nocturnal light effects which he developed much further than his artistic predecessors had done, and transferred their use in the genre subjects in the paintings of the Dutch Caravaggisti to religious painting in his. Unlike Caravaggio his religious paintings lack dramatic effects. He painted these in a second phase of his style, perhaps beginning in the 1640s, using chiaroscuro, careful geometrical compositions, and very simplified painting of forms.

It shows the chaotic scene of the Greek warriors, mid-transformation, scurrying around to-and-frow on Circe’s palace grounds, likely before they were beaten and prodded into the pigsties. Nevertheless, the beastly affliction of the Greek adventurers was not permanent. Their clever leader, Odysseus, who had not been present for the initial banquet, was later able to convince Circe to turn the crew back into their original humanoid forms. From then on, Circe and Odysseus’ crew were able to coexist. The tiny figures of Ulysses, Circe, and her entourage are secondary to the magnificently decorated palace, the lush landscape, and the assortment of lively animals. The painting is a collaborative effort of two painters: the Flemish artist Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg, a specialist in depicting architecture, painted the palace and garden house, while the German artist Carl Borromäus Andreas Ruthart was responsible for the naturalistic display of animals in the foreground.",2022-05-06 21:09:00+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/6604,,,492,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The painting depicts a story taken from Homer's Odyssey, in which the sorceress Circe encounters the warrior Ulysses. Descending the palace stairs on the left, Circe greets Ulysses and offers him a magic potion. Previous to his arrival, the sorceress had given the same potion to Ulysses's men, who were then transformed into wild beasts. On the right, one man sports antlers while another one nearby is horrified to find his head changing into that of a wild boar. Unbeknownst to Circe, however, Ulysses has taken an herbal antidote given to him by Hermes. Ulysses will overcome the sorceress and force her to restore his men to their normal shape. “Circe ushered the rest into her hall, gave them seats and chairs to sit on, and then prepared them a mixture of cheese, barley-meal, and yellow honey flavored with Pramnian wine. But into this dish she introduced a noxious drug, to make them lose all memory of their native land. And when they had emptied the bowls which she handed them, she drove them with blows of a stick into the pigsties. Now they had pig heads and bristles, and they grunted like pigs; but their minds were as human as they had been before” (Homer, The Odyssey, book 10, approximately lines 230-240).",2022-05-06 21:08:29+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/6603,,,1566,0,14,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this portrait painted shortly after her marriage, Louise-Antoinette prominently displays her wedding band on her left hand. In a style reminiscent of seventeenth-century Dutch painters, Millet painted the modestly dressed sitter against a plain background using a limited palette.

At the time, animal bladders served as toys, either inflated and tossed like balloons or filled with dried peas and shaken like rattles. In European art, bladders often functioned as symbolic variants on soap bubbles, fragile playthings signifying the brevity of human life and the transience of human achievement. Although bladders were depicted frequently in seventeenth-century Dutch paintings, they were less common in eighteenth-century British art, and Wright has taken liberties with the motif. The elaborate costumes—with their frilled collars and cuffs—worn by the boys seem to be of the artist's own invention, in the style of contemporary British ""fancy pictures.""",2022-05-06 10:19:13+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/6587,,,1145,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hers is purple-blue, with a floral pattern inspired in Ottoman models. His is a complementary bright orange. They do justice to Veronese’s fame as a painter of vibrant colours, and they are a reminder that one of the virtues of our artist is that he teaches us to be lovers of beauty - especially the beauty of colours and chromatic harmony. The colour orange is most striking here. Veronese created this bright hue by combining minium and the rare pigment realgar, the only pure orange pigment available at the time, which contained arsenic (it was used to kill rats). The verdant, luscious surroundings recall the ideal place for love as this was described in ancient and contemporary pastoral poetry. The contrast between the tempting nakedness of the goddess and her expression is dramatic. Her parted mouth, wide-open eyes, and lifted brow express surprise; soon she will feel an intense emotional pain.",2022-05-05 23:18:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/6563,,,589,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Venus is fair skinned and has rosy cheeks and lips, following an ideal of beauty explained in writing since Antiquity, and renewed in the poetry of Petrarch. She is the goddess of beauty, love, and fertility, and is as beautiful here as an anthropomorphic understanding of the gods allows. Veronese has always been recognised as a painter of beauty. The seated, contrapposto pose of Venus was inspired by an ancient statue of a crouching Aphrodite surprised at her bath that is sometimes attributed to the sculptor Doidalsas of Bithynia. In our painting, Venus is shown covering her naked upper body with one of her arms, as much as this is possible. She is cast in the guise of a fashionable Venetian temptress. She cools Adonis with a flag-fan and wears a gold bracelet, a pearl necklace, and carefully coiffured hair.",2022-05-05 23:11:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/6562,,,558,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The series depicted the adventures of the Trojan hero Aeneas, venerated in Italy since antiquity as a founder of the Roman state. The obscure iconography of Dosso's canvas has caused much speculation. In the past it has been titled simply Scene from a Legend and, more often, Departure of the Argonauts. The present title refers instead to an event in Virgil's Aeneid.

Under the influence of paintings by the Venetians and Correggio, the motif of a semi-fantastic landscape illuminated by a mysterious, flickering light enters into the work of Dossi, who was considered the head of the Ferrara school of painting. Dosso Dossi (c. 1479–1542), or Giovanni de Lutero, came from Trentino area and studied in the workshop of Lorenzo Costa. Moreover, the painter was influenced by Giorgione and Raphael. Dossi worked at the court of the dukes in Ferrara, as well as in Modena, Mantua and Venice, and was chief painter for the Ferrara d’Este family, but almost nothing remained of the murals of the ducal palaces and castles made by him.",2022-05-05 21:19:49+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/6553,,,501,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,6.026331482748882e+18,,23-50-17-DossoDossi.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The apostles were brought by angels to the Virgin's death-bed and assisted in her burial in a tomb in the Vale of Josaphat; there she was assumed (that is, 'carried up'), body and soul, into heaven, 'great multitude of angels keeping her company'. St John of Damascus (c.675–c.749) called the Virgin the 'font of true light' and likened her assumption to the sun appearing after an eclipse. Rubens uses a similar metaphor, creating a heavenly glory around the Virgin in the likeness of the rising sun. Rubens departs from usual practice in including the sisters, Sts Mary and Martha, symbols of the active and contemplative life, with the apostles round the tomb.",2022-05-04 20:46:39+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/6506,,,573,0,9,1,PeerChannel,1561395949.0,ThirstForBeauty,2022-01-18 16:45:07,2022-01-18,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2872,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These plans of recession are used by Brueghel to imitate the effects of atmospheric perspective and thus create an illusion of the landscape’s depth.

The story is recounted in the New Testament and is mentioned in three of the four Gospels. Brueghel depicts the boat, lashed by the waves with Christ asleep inside, at the precise moment when one of the disciples decides to wake him before they are all shipwrecked.

The view of the eastern section of Toledo from the north would have excluded the cathedral, which the artist therefore imaginatively moved to the left of the Alcázar (the royal palace).

One can almost sense the hushed tones in which Esther and Mordecai converse as they stand together in the dark, vaulted room.

This haunting nocturnal scene depicts a drama from the Book of Esther in which the Old Testament figure Mordecai, a Jew, speaks to his cousin Esther about a conspiracy to massacre the Jews. He begs Esther, who is the wife of the Persian King Ahasuerus to use her influence to stop plot. Esther agrees and later pleads with her husband to spare her people.

In the distance on the left a man at the top of the steps holds clenched fists to his eyes: this is the last king of Judah, Zedekiah, who was blinded by Nebuchadnezzar. The prominent domed building in the background is probably Solomon's Temple. Jeremiah's pose, his head supported by his hand, is a traditional attitude of melancholy: his elbow rests on a large book which is inscribed 'Bibel' on the edge of the pages, probably a much later addition to the painting.

The manuscript was commissioned in Savoy between 1460 and 1477 by canon Jean de Montchenu, a noblemen, apostolic prothonotary, later Bishop of Agen and Bishop of Vivier. This exceptional MS, closed, is shaped like a heart; when open it becomes two hearts joined, representing two lovers who send love messages to one another in each one of the songs. When the word “heart” appears in the texts, it is represented by a pictogram. Two full-page illustrations appear in the codex. In the first, Cupid throws arrows at a young girl while at his side Fortune spins his wheel. In the other, two lovers approach one another lovingly. Throughout the MS the pentagrams, music and love poems are surrounded by borders made up of animals, birds, dogs, cats and all kinds of flowers and plants highlighted in abundant and delicate gold.",2022-05-01 22:34:45+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/6380,,,452,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the newly chosen pope proceeded from the sacristy of St. Peter's Basilica in his sedia gestatoria, the procession stopped three times. On each occasion, a papal master of ceremonies would fall to his knees before the pope, holding a silver or brass reed, bearing a tow of smoldering flax.

As we move higher up, the figures become less solid and the paint application lighter, leaving the prepared ground visible. The painting´s meaning is difficult to establish. Aretino, Vasari and Charles V´s inventory refer to it as The Trinity, but in the emperor´s codicil it is entitled a Last Judgement. It acquires a devotional character when we consider that Charles contemplated it while he was dying, which would explain why it was called a Last Judgement. The painting also allows for a political reading. It is significant that along with the family members whom Charles wished to present to the Trinity, there are others notable by their absence, such as his brother Ferdinand and his nephew Maximilian, presumably left out as a result of the crisis that developed between Philip and Ferdinand with regard to the imperial succession during the meeting at Augsburg.",2022-05-01 00:50:04+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/6324,,,527,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,6.012631361708363e+18,,La_Gloria_(Tiziano).jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several of the buildings are successfully foreshortened, and the relationship between buildings and figures is more effectively managed than in most Byzantine painting. The painting is done with unusual freedom compared to most Byzantine work; it is this feature in particular which relates to much earlier works from the late antiquity such as paintings found in the catacombs of Rome. Some art historians see the style as coming from the tradition of Alexandria, from which no other painting on a similar scale remains. The Byzantinesque frescoes are located around the curved wall of the apse, and the inward surface of the arch between the apse and the main body of the church.

It speaks of Divine power acting through one of its creatures, the young widow Judith, who liberates her people by beheading Holofernes, King Nebuchadnezzar’s general. Judith is portrayed as a vulnerable young woman standing alone in the murdered general’s tent. Holding the still bloody sword, she places one hand gently on the general’s severed head. A moment shown as if in flashlight was a recurrent device in Neapolitan painting. Judging from her half-open mouth and stooping posture, the Biblical heroine Judith is exhausted (or possibly ecstatic) after having severed the head of the general Holofernes, which she just has placed beside her. The sword is partly hidden in the folds of her garment.

Two men secretly observed her there. They waited for the moment when Susanna would send away her maids so as to seduce her. However, Susanna resisted their approaches virtuously, thus entering the annals of history and art as a heroine of chastity and piety. Connected to an old Florentine tradition, the painter succeeds in perfectly harmonising the elegant stylisation of form and naturalistic elements, depicting in 1600 - unlike many other artists - the prologue of the story. The way of capturing the luster of a silk, of releasing a face in pure volume, characterize this very balanced composition.

The painting is executed in mixed techniques on wood; it measures about 26 by 33 centimetres. It is on display at the Städel Museum in Frankfurt, Germany. The painting belongs to the Maria im Rosenhag (Mary in the rose bower) type, but the painter adapted that style uniquely. In contrast to depictions current at the time, the Virgin Mary is not depicted in the centre of the image, but in the upper left corner, engrossed in a book. She is surrounded by Saints. To her right, Saint Dorothy is plucking a cherry, Saint Barbara is drawing water from a well, and Saint Cecilia holds a psaltery, on which the Child Jesus is plucking the strings.

Two bearded snakes form the handle on either side of the vase. With their upper bodies coiled on the broad shoulder, they stretch their flat heads forward across the deep concavity of the neck to bite the projecting rim, setting up a play of spatial depth and light and dark effects. The motif of entwined serpents is appropriate for a funerary vase. Linked with the earth, snakes were associated with chthonian powers, and the Greeks and Romans regarded them as guardians of sacred places, houses, and tombs.

Sigurd hewed at the anvil and split it to its base. The blade did not shatter or break” (chapter 15). It is this scene of Sigurd inspecting his blade after having split the anvil in two that Ferdinand Leeke painted. After the sword passed the anvil test, Sigurd was still not convinced. Next, he brought the sword to a river, where he tossed a tuft of wool into the stream. Sigurd stood downstream from the wool, holding the edge of the blade in the path of the floating tuft. When the current brought the wool into contact with the blade, the woolen fibers immediately and cleanly split in two. With this, assured that the blade was incredibly durable and sharp, Sigurd finally brought the sword home.

Although the young exile never knew his father, one important keepsake that belonged to King Sigmund was preserved for Sigurd. His mother, Hjordis, had managed to gather all of the broken pieces of slain King Sigmund’s sword before she fled the country. These shards of metal, however, were more than mere memorabilia, for King Sigmund claimed that the blade was a gift from the god, Odin. When Sigurd finally came of age, he obtained the pieces of the broken sword from his mother and brought them to a smith named Regin to repair the godly weapon. Regin agreed to repair it, setting in motion the scene that Ferdinand Leeke recreated in his painting.",2022-04-29 13:46:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/6196,,,498,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following the death of its creator, it was lost for more than two centuries before its rediscovery in Brussels. It is possible that the painting was in its creator's workshop in Delft at the time of the gunpowder explosion that killed him and destroyed much of the city. The Goldfinch is a trompe-l'œil painting which uses artistic techniques to create the illusion of depth, notably through foreshortening of the head, but also by highlights on the rings and the bird's foot, and strong shadows on the plastered wall. Bold strokes of bright colours above and lighter touches of duller colours below also accentuate the visual effect. The viewpoint seems to be from slightly below the bird, suggesting it was intended to be mounted in an elevated position. The lack of a frame initially also suggests the painting may have been mounted to look realistic.",2022-04-28 15:58:17+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/6154,,,533,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,6.005626416077475e+18,,0605_repro.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whatever the panel’s initial purpose — possibly a component of a birdcage or a cover for an encased painting — the little bird chained to his feed box is a masterpiece of trompe l’oeil illusionism. Vermeer — like Fabritius, a resident of Delft — was highly influenced by the artist’s pristine lighting and composed tranquility. A common and colourful bird with a pleasant song, the goldfinch was a popular pet, and could be taught simple tricks including lifting a thimble-sized bucket of water.

Ixion was an ancient king of the Lapiths who offended Zeus twice, and for his crimes, Ixion was expelled from Olympus and Zeus ordered Hermes to bind him to a wheel (sometimes a wheel of fire) that would spin eternally. Ribera's painting shows the beginning of Ixion's torment; the wheel is barely visible in the background just above Ixion's torso and we can see the chain around Ixion's legs. There is a devilish imp binding Ixion, perhaps meant to represent Hermes but is more likely a generic demon. This painting is remarkable for its masterful use of chiaroscuro and for the depiction of Ixion's body. The contorting muscles and twisting shape are rendered with incredible detail and realism. Even barely showing Ixion's face, Ribera successfully communicated his suffering using his body. Overall the painting is stunning in its intensity.",2022-04-27 14:39:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/6117,,,657,0,5,1,PeerChannel,1561395949.0,ThirstForBeauty,2021-11-10 21:46:01,2021-11-10,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1256,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Where you die I will die and there I will be buried.’",2022-04-27 07:37:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/6099,,,669,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First there are bearded, winged figures wearing a horned helmet. Next there are bearded, winged figures wearing a diadem instead of helmet. Finally there are winged, muscular, male figures with bird heads.

The following year he painted Adam and Eve in mourning. Low clouds and somber palatte are a bleak departure from Bouguereau’s sensual, crowd pleasing academic work, and his Adam and Eve look like they will never be the same again. The First Mourning is a silent painting, breath caught before a rending sob. One could not look at it without “feeling the impact of a powerful sense of grief […] everything in it is natural: light and shadow. There is not one strong color; nothing, absolutely nothing.

This work depicts the moment after Adam and Eve just found the body of their son Abel, who was murdered by Cain, the first human death recorded in the Bible. This is a striking painting because of the way it deals with death. William-Adolphe Bouguereau reframes the parable, showing us two parents devastated by the death of a beloved son, who behold their body. Few things on earth can compare to the sorrow parents feel at the death of a child.

The metaphor for Hispania’s historic mission, the triumphant Battle of Clavijo in 844, seemed the perfect choice of subject for the location: the nation’s patron saint appears as a vision to lead the Christians to victory against the pagans. Once finished, the painting was celebrated at a public exhibition in San Marco in Venice, and Tiepolo’s son reproduced prints of it. Yet it was not, finally, installed in its intended place: the Spanish turned shy at the sight of the enormous battlehorse dominating most of the picture, which when placed on an altar would, they opined, provide fodder for the Protestants’ accusations of idolatry in the Catholic veneration of images.

The colorful but unreliable Augustan History, a late Roman collection of biographies, states that Zenobia associated herself with the Ptolemies of Egypt, including Cleopatra. Eastern historians believed that Zenobia was not Greek but of Arab descent. Modern historians agree that the queen of Palmyra did not descend from the Ptolemies and most likely came from an influential Palmyrene family in which she had been well educated. Much like her birth, the exact circumstances of Zenobia’s death are uncertain. Some sources claim she committed suicide to avoid captivity. Roman sources claim that Aurelian, unwilling to put a woman to death, brought her as a captive to Rome. The queen, it was said, had always longed to visit Rome, “and this hope was not unfulfilled,” the Augustan History recorded with irony. Some sources claim she was decapitated there. Others recount that she married a Roman senator and lived out her life as a Roman matron.",2022-04-24 22:04:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/5989,,,691,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.994640254806528e+18,,queen_zenobia_addressing_her_soldiers_1961.9.42.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If that did not work, perhaps the Romans would succumb to hunger and the merciless desert climate. According to the Augustan History, the queen fired off a message full of characteristic defiance: “From Zenobia, Queen of the East, to Aurelian Augustus... You demand my surrender as though you were not aware that Cleopatra preferred to die a queen rather than remain alive, however high her rank.” Stung by this rebuff from a woman, Aurelian redoubled his efforts to take the city. In desperation, the queen tried to flee eastward to Persia but was captured—the Augustan History relates—and was brought before Emperor Aurelian, all while the city has surrendered, and pleading for her life, Zenobia reportedly blamed her anti-Roman policy on one of her advisers, the Greek-born philosopher Cassius Longinus, whom Aurelian then had executed.",2022-04-24 21:59:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/5986,,,640,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The challenge she presented far exceeded that of a male ruler gone rogue: “Now all shame is exhausted,” the Augustan History lamented, “for in the weakened state of the [Roman] commonwealth things came to such a pass that... a foreigner, Zenobia by name... proceeded to cast about her shoulders the imperial mantle [and ruled] longer than could be endured from one of the female sex.” Aurelian retaliated, taking back territory from Zenobia as his legions advanced through Asia Minor and arrived at the city walls in 272.",2022-04-24 21:55:09+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/5985,,,614,0,9,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the next, short-lived Roman emperor, Claudius Gothicus, acceded, he had no choice but to recognize her sovereignty. Zenobia had achieved her aim: to make Palmyra an equal to Rome.

The table was to be perceived by visitors to the church as an extension in perspective of the high altar, or conversely the high altar was to be seen as a prolongation of the table for the Last Supper. The priestly bearing of Christ and the liturgical utensils on the small side table play on the same connection. The winged apparitions characterize the Eucharist as the ""bread of angels"" (St Thomas Aquinas) and in their non-material, other-worldly nature indicate the mystery of transubstantiation (the transformation of bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ).

The centre of the scene is occupied not by the apostles but instead by secondary characters, such as a woman carrying a dish and the servants taking the dishes from the table. However, a supernatural scene with winged figures comes into sight by the light around his head. This endows the painting with a visional character clearly differentiating it from paintings of the same subject made by earlier painters like Leonardo. Furthermore, Tintoretto's painting features a more personal use of light, which appears to come into obscurity from both the light on the ceiling and from Jesus' aureola. The work makes use of Mannerist devices in its complex and radically asymmetrical composition.

The style in which it was painted marks an important transition in art. The harmonious compositions of the Renaissance were gradually replaced by exaggerated forms of these ideals. This marks the conclusion of the transition from Mannerism to Baroque. Upon the first viewing, Tintoretto’s Last Supper is wholly disorienting. The painting is a conglomeration of people, color, and mystery grouped under a title that immediately ties it to da Vinci’s older, more famous depiction of the same event. But Tintoretto imagines a less formal, more enigmatic scene. Like da Vinci’s painting, Christ is still central, but the rest of the painting crowds in on all sides, overwhelming the eye and mind. https://www.yalelogos.com/home/beholding-mystery",2022-04-24 13:55:10+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/5957,,,679,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mezentius was an Etruscan king who was notoriously cruel, and known to the Romans as a ‘despiser of the gods’. He apparently took particular pleasure in executing people by chaining them to corpses, and leaving them to die slowly as the corpse next to them decayed. This canvas is related to the Poème de l’Ame since one of the cartoon drawings, depicts the same scene. In a desolate landscape, with a mountainous background, and quite different from the cartoon which shows mainly rocks, a young man is tied to a dead woman whose flesh is already turning blue. Unlike Virgil’s text, they are not tied hand to hand, face to face, no doubt more difficult to evoke.",2022-04-23 22:07:18+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/5944,,,502,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Pharisee criticised Christ for allowing so sinful a woman to touch him and for allowing the waste of valuable ointment. Jesus said to the woman: ""Thy sins are forgiven. Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace."" To the Pharisees he said: ""Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much.""

They used a technique known as embossing or repoussé and chasing—the ornamentation of metal by raising designs in relief from the surface and then chiseling and filing the details on the front. Because this method seriously weakened armor plate and eliminated the smooth surfaces that served to deflect weapons, embossed armors were created exclusively for ceremonial use in military and civic festivals. Following the tradition of the Negroli armor workshop, Milanese armorers pursued new pictorial and sculptural styles of armor decoration. Shields, helmets, and entire armors were embossed with complex, multifigured scenes from ancient history, legends, mythology, and the Bible. To further enrich the raised surfaces, they were often damascened with gold or silver and contrasted with a russet or blued background.",2022-04-22 18:24:07+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/5824,,,522,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His friend Frederic George Stephens wrote a pamphlet containing a detailed explanation of the content and the characters. It was then shown in a series of popular travelling exhibitions at which visitors could buy the pamphlet and subscribe to an engraved reproduction.

Spencer was a popular inspiration for nineteenth century painters and the chivalric quest of the knights in The Faerie Queene provided many Pre-Raphaelite painters with subjects.

The Lord instructed Moses to go to the Pharaoh and lead the oppressed sons of Israel out of Egypt. Moses covered his face with his hands, since he was afraid to look at God.

The muses had to judge, but they always tied in their interpretation, until Apollo introduced the need to sing while playing, something that he could do because his instrument was a lyre while for Marsyas it was impossible because he played the aulos. As a punishment, Marsyas is hung on a tree and skinned alive, while looking at the viewer as if begging for his intervention or help. On the contrary, the god is represented in an almost idealized and serene way, pleased by his triumph and subsequent action. The theme is somewhat crude, typical of Ribera's painting.

The imagery is perfectly compatible with Ribera’s vision of the ancient world, as reflected in his scenes of the martyrdom of the Apostles. The Roman historians Dio Cassius and Suetonius describe games held in honour of the Emperors Nero and Domitian in which women fought each other, and Juvenal in one of his satires thunders in disgust against this particular spectacle. While it is unlikely that Ribera knew ancient images of female gladiators (very few actually survive), he must have known the print of women fighters in Justus Lipsius’s Saturnalium (1604), an illustrated compendium of Roman gladiatorial practices.",2022-04-21 16:38:17+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/5742,,,483,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.985421872009841e+18,,4a6b41c0-3a84-4a31-9883-918c59c70fd5.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the background, to the left, is a man in Roman military dress resting on a staff, and behind the wall of the arena stand soldiers and male civilians watching the spectacle. The composition is framed by diagonally arranged spears which emphasise the military character of the scene. But what in fact is the subject of the picture? The early Prado catalogues record that the painting shows a duel that took place in 1552 in the presence of the Viceroy of Naples, the Marquis of Vasto, between two Neapolitan women, Isabella de Carazi and Diambra de Petinella, over their love of a handsome youth named Fabio de Zeresola, but there are difficulties with the proposal because no figures can be reasonably identified in the background.",2022-04-21 16:33:47+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/5741,,,466,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the subject of this painting remains uncertain, its composition is connected to two drawings by the artist that illustrate the story of Danaë and her infant son Perseus, who were set adrift in a chest by Acrisius, Danaë’s father. The figure riding a chariot in the background at the right may be Poseidon, who, following Zeus’s command, brought mother and child to safety on the island of Seriphos.

When the work was completed, the artist realized that he depicted so genuine and really inconsolable grief that a buyer to find would be a wonder – hardly anyone would wish to decorate their living room with this canvas. Kramskoy wrote Pavel Tretyakov a letter with a request to take up this work as a gift. Tretyakov refused to take the picture as a gift, but bought it instead. The money were very helpful to Kramskoy. As a painter Kramskoy was satisfied with this work. He knew that it should have its purpose, and even said: ""If this picture doesn't sell, I most peaceful way turn to the wall and forget about it, I did my job"".",2022-04-20 18:57:45+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/5693,,,495,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.981266048769329e+18,,comment_1623249401rM6iOrNCtmaPmnuIu9z60o.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was always a single panel and its small scale suggests it was for private enjoyment. The iconography is unusual and must have had a particular meaning for the original commissioner. In some ways it resembles manuscript illuminations made for French aristocracy: the Virgin and Child shown in a sunburst comes from the medieval Apocalypse, the illustrated Book of Revelations, in which a woman clothed in the sun gives birth to a child to rule all nations. Saints George and Anthony were very widely venerated in northern Italy and they were often shown together, although rarely alone like this. Saint Anthony was a hermit, while Saint George was regarded as a patron of the medieval knightly class. Perhaps they represent two different ways of life, the ascetic – that is, renouncing worldly riches and pleasure – and the courtly.",2022-04-20 18:11:28+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/5673,,,451,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.981266048769329e+18,,Pisanello_014.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this and his obvious trepidation, the soldier still stands firm. Poynter's source was the excavation at Pompeii of the remains of a soldier in full armour.

It may be viewed as bolstering the legitimacy of Charles V and his family in the context of the Hundred Years' War, by emphasizing their Carolingian lineage. It was repaired on multiple occasions, including in 1722, 1775, 1804 and 1825. The crown is not original and was replaced at some date before 1624. The scepter held by Charlemagne and one of the eagles on his seat are also replacements. In 1804, the scepter's shaft was restored using what was until then a separate precious object, known as the staff of Guillaume de Roquémont, originally created in 1394. The fleur-de-lis was enameled in white in the past.

The statue of Charlemagne crowning the sceptre, and in particular the rendering of the face, shows how closely the style of such work corresponded to the realistic tendencies of contemporary monumental sculpture.

It precedes - albeit by just a few months - the portrait of her husband, Francesco Maria I della Rovere, Duke of Urbino. Painted as a companion, and although not conceived to be a comparison - strictly in terms of composition - it is deeply complementary, since one depicts a prototype of the valorous man of arms and the other is the perfect example of the faithful bride (the dog is in fact a symbol of marital fidelity), an embodiment of womanly virtue.

In the summer of 1536, the duke asked for the return of his parade armour, sent to Venice a few months beforehand so that Titian could reproduce it faithfully in the portrait that he was painting, making the most of the presence of the Duke of Urbino in Venice in his capacity as General Captain of the Serenissima. Titian portrays Francesco Maria to mid thigh level, with his Venetian baton in his fist and wearing a polished suit of armour that stands out against a background of crimson velvet cloth.

He obtained the small living at Bemerton, a village on the Avon near Salisbury, and there wrote the poems which he said presented ‘a picture of the many spiritual conflicts that have passed between God and my soul’. In 1860 the rector of the parish of Bemerton was William Dyce’s friend Cyril Page. Dyce visited him there and painted this picture of the poet in his garden, with its view across the water meadows to Salisbury Cathedral.

The scene unfolds in front of a wide, placid expanse of land, depicted with a sure-handed knowledge of luminous, atmospheric perspective.",2022-04-18 12:46:44+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/5528,,,479,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's is one of the first preserved works of Raphael in which his natural dramatic style of composition was already obvious, as opposed to the gentle poetic style of his master, Pietro Perugino. The extremely rational composition is ruled by a complex ideal geometry which interlinks all the elements of the scene and gives it a strange animated rhythm, transforming the characters in the painting into co-protagonists in a unique ""choreography"". The painting possesses an esthetic influence from Pinturicchio and Melozzo da Forlì, though the spatial orchestration of the work, with its tendency to movement, shows Raphael's knowledge of the Florentine artistic milieu of the 16th century.",2022-04-18 12:39:12+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/5525,,,445,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.974210173416245e+18,,Rafael_-_ressureicaocristo01.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His young David, portrayed with neoclassical calm in a Grecian-style tunic, takes a pose that recalls not only Renaissance bronze statuettes but also an ancient statue, surviving at the Capitoline Museums in Rome, that later became central to Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel The Marble Faun. David's identity as a sweet singer and future psalmist, not explored in the Florentine Renaissance statues, is evoked here by the harp, for which the sculptor used an innovative combination of bronze and marble. He ingeniously encouraged alternative main viewpoints, setting both the oval shield on which David stands and the face of Goliath in a position diagonally crossing the square plinth that bears the signature inscription on its front.",2022-04-17 22:09:54+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/5498,,,647,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.972229506298023e+18,,david_triumphant_2008.93.1.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oedipus became popular in France just after the French Revolution, since the subject addressed the return of exiles. The ancient Greek writer Sophocles provided the best-known version of the tragedy, but an interpretation that played in Paris in 1797 inspired Harriet’s work.

Anne reacts with fury to his words, but like a fly caught in a net, she soon succumbs to his flattery, and the artful duke becomes her husband and England’s next king.",2022-04-17 20:30:56+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/5475,,,508,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a book of hours: a collection of prayers to be said at the canonical hours. It was created between c. 1412 and 1416 for the extravagant royal bibliophile and patron John, Duke of Berry, by the Limbourg brothers. When the three painters and their sponsor died in 1416, possibly victims of plague, the manuscript was left unfinished. It was further embellished in the 1440s by an anonymous painter, who many art historians believe was Barthélemy d'Eyck. In 1485–1489, it was brought to its present state by the painter Jean Colombe on behalf of the Duke of Savoy. Acquired by the Duc d'Aumale in 1856, the book is now MS 65 in the Musée Condé, Chantilly, France.",2022-04-15 22:06:34+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/5367,,,528,0,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the central middleground, William sits astride his horse dressed in chain mail with bones hanging from a red cord around his neck. A number of his men, some of them wounded, are around him. The dead Harold is brought before him, carried by soldiers, crown on his head and a broken battle-axe still clenched in his hand. Three men stand to the left looking upon the scene; the first man in a red tunic holds up Harold’s legs by a leather strap, the second prays, the third carries several spears and a red standard. To the right, a monk kneels besides a wounded man, bandaging his leg; the injured man leans on a dead soldier and a round shield as he turns to see the dead king. In the bottom left corner, two men are entwined in combat, one having stabbed his attacker in the back.

Numitor's younger brother Amulius seized the throne and killed Numitor's son, then forced Rhea Silvia to become a Vestal Virgin, a priestess of the goddess Vesta. As Vestal Virgins were sworn to celibacy, this would ensure the line of Numitor had no heirs. Rhea, however, became pregnant with the twins Romulus and Remus by the god Mars. According to Plutarch, she believed this because she saw her children being cared for by a wood pecker and a wolf – animals sacred to Mars. The account says that Rhea Silvia went to a grove sacred to Mars to get water for use in the temple where she encountered Mars who attempted to rape her, she ran into a cave to escape him but to no avail. Mars then promised that her children would be great. These claims of her children's paternity were later doubted by the Roman historian Livy.

The basic model for women consists of an embroidered blouse and skirt, belt, head scarf, and often a vest or jacket. As in many cultures, embroidery is placed at ""vulnerable"" areas of the body: the neck, cuffs, and hem, but also at the shoulders and sleeves as a symbol of strength. This example of a full festival costume is striking in the variation of blue tones and abundant embroidery. The coordination of the various components is symbolic of the pride and care given to folk traditions in Romanian culture.",2022-04-12 21:54:11+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/5240,,,609,0,12,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jesus is said to have spent time on the mount, teaching and prophesying to his disciples (Matthew 24–25), including the Olivet discourse, returning after each day to rest (Luke 21:37, and John 8:1 in the additional section of John's Gospel known as the Pericope Adulterae), and also coming there on the night of his betrayal.

Just as the space is constricted, so are several different events from Shakespeare's play conflated into a single moment. The canvas's compressed form and content, as well as Abbey's attention to period costume, have their roots in the English Pre-Raphaelite movement with which the artist was associated. His approach also evokes the pictorialist fashion in late Victorian theater, which valued elaborate visual spectacle over plot to the degree that Shakespeare's texts were often radically shortened to accommodate time-consuming changes of intricate costume and scenery. Abbey labored over his ambitious canvases, however, and during or after the display of ""Who Is Sylvia?"" at the Royal Academy, Abbey scraped out Sylvia's head and repainted it from another model.

It was suggested that the phrase ""Et in Arcadia ego"" is derived from a line from Daphnis' funeral in Virgil's Fifth Eclogue Daphnis ego in silvis (""Daphnis was I amid the woods""), and that it referred to the dead shepherd within the tomb, rather than Death itself. An early work of Guercino, the painting was executed before his Roman period (1621-23) and after his voyage to Venice, where this sort of moralizing allegory was quite popular.",2022-04-11 11:14:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/5148,,,583,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It shows two young shepherds who have discovered a skull. The title could be interpreted as a sentence uttered by Death (""I too am in Arcadia""). But any moral significance to the work is lost in a moment of pure contemplation. Quotations from Correggio and Venetian art are completely in tune with the depth and sensitivity of feeling typical of Guercino. Guercino transforms the rustic onlookers into protagonists in a self-sufficient moralizing theme. An effective exploration of the memento mori is attained by the addition of the skull, with its worm and fly, and the inscription Et in Arcadia ego.",2022-04-11 11:10:05+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/5147,,,598,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This type presents the Virgin in her role as mother and as protector of mankind. The icon is made of mosaic. It is a very expensive technique, rarely used on portable icons. In the middle of the lower frame can be seen a notch into which a pole was fitted, so that it could be processed during litanies, that is, ceremonial processions through the city streets. The rest of the time the icon would have been kept on the iconostasis of a church. It comes from Triglia in Bithynia, near Constantinople, and ended up in the Byzantine and Christian Museum as one of the """"Refugees' Heirlooms"""", which came to Greece after the Asia Minor Disaster (1922).

As aceramic artist, the Niobid Painter was interested in depicting specific themes and historical episodes drawn from mythology and epic poetry. The obverse of the Cincinnati krater depicts one such episode, taken from the Homeric cycle on the Trojan War. Here a goddess with a diadem, holding a spear, intervenes in a combat between two warriors. One advances with lance poised, while the other falls backward with sword drawn in self-defense. The most likely contestants in this battle are the Greek hero Achilles and his Trojan adversary Hector.

The two sculptors were commissioned by Cosimo I to produce his portrait in bronze as proof of their respective abilities. For Baccio, this was his chance to regain the appraisal of the Grand Duke, who had not been happy with one of his previous portraits, commissioned for Palazzo Vecchio. In this work in particular the physiognomy of the portrait is surpassed by the sculptor’s attempt to place the figure in a precise historical and cultural context. He created the bust bearing in mind the ancient statuary tradition and it aims to show that the Medici family belonged to a historical past characterized by civil and politic virtues.

Millais also carefully characterises each figure with equal precision. Another distinctive Pre-Raphaelite feature is the inclusion of images and patterns within the image as a whole.

Over the years it managed to link together the various houses it had built and purchased over time into a unified ensemble of palaces, courtyards, and gardens. In the seventeenth century, the art-loving cardinal Girolamo I Colonna (1604-1666) began turning the complex into a Baroque residence. Construction began in 1650. The south wing, containing the Grande Galleria, was built between 1661 and 1700 at the behest of the cardinal's nephew Lorenzo Onofrio (1637-1689). It is more than a story and a half in height, and it receives light from both sides. In the east anteroom Chiari painted this ceiling.

When a Palatine count discovers that the young man is having a love affair with his wife he sentences him to be tied naked to horse and sent back to Ukraine, his native country. Byron writes, ‘With sudden wrath I [Mazeppa] wrenched my head, And snapped the cord, which to the mane Had bound my neck in lieu of rein, And, writhing half my form about, Howled back my curse; […]’ And so the hero makes it known that he will seek revenge and looks to the day when ‘There is not of that castle gate, Its drawbridge and portcullis weight, Stone, bar, moat, bridge, or barrier left, […]’",2022-04-09 13:22:38+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/5048,,,595,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fact that the painting was not given a more specific title does not mean that Rembrandt had no specific subject in mind. Assuming that he intended the painting to be more than merely a genre scene, the most likely explanation is that it represents St Peter and St Paul in conversation. There were several earlier representations of this theme in art which show the two apostles as bearded scholars seated together, with one expounding a passage in a sacred book which the other holds on his knee. Rembrandt omits the attributes by which the two apostles were traditionally identified, he relies only on their physical characteristics, as established by artistic precedent, and on what they are seen to be doing, that is earnestly discussing a text which the one (St Peter) is explaining to the other.",2022-04-07 18:26:54+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4969,,,524,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was expulsed from Heaven when he rebelled against His power. To represent the subject, Esquivel chose the moment when, with a stern expression, Saint Michael separates him from Celestial Glory. The subject is comparable to Saint Michael´s fight with the dragon of sin, which was frequently depicted by innumerable artists. Nevertheless, Esquivel eschews the customary image of the saint with helmet and sword, concentrating instead on both figures´ expressions, one stern, the other, hateful. This painting was approached with an esthetic eclecticism that mixes the Spanish pictorial tradition, as embodied by Murillo, with the purism of Madrid´s court painting from that period, which was greatly influenced by the work of Ingres. It was warmly received by the critics, who praised its most notable characteristics: correct coloring, accurate rendering of the figures, and perfect composition.",2022-04-07 14:21:10+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4958,,,733,0,16,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He renewed the genre of heroic landscape painting, which had been established by the seventeenth-century French masters Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin. Koch’s fame rests on this iconic image, which he referred to as a “Greek landscape.” It is the fourth and final version of a composition he first painted in 1805.",2022-04-06 21:05:51+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4907,,,526,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The breakthrough, above all for Swedish glass, came at the 1925 World’s Fair in Paris. Better things for everyday life was the slogan under which artists were recruited by the industry to design useful, beautiful – but also simple inexpensive – objects for the increased well-being of all. The traditional art market of unique handmade objects for wealthy consumers thrived at the same time, and tended to dominate at international fairs – but was accompanied by the utopian urging beauty for all. This celestial globe is engraved with the twelve signs of the zodiac. Glass engraving was an almost forgotten technique when Orrefors revived the method in the 1910s. Simon Gate and Edward Hald won great international acclaim, enabling the glassworks to start a school for engravers. At most, there were 36 engravers working at the factory at the same time.

When Repin painted Golgotha, in the wake of World War I and the Russian Revolution, separated from friends and associates in Russia by a redrawn border with Finland, the artist was beset by anxiety for his homeland and by physical handicaps that included the atrophy of his right hand. The difficulty and expense of obtaining canvas for a large-scale work like Golgotha prompted him to use ordinary linoleum (reversed to expose its burlap backing) as a surface for this painting. While never primarily a religious painter, Repin renewed his allegiance to the Russian Orthodox Church at this time. Religious subject matter, not previously of major consequence in his work, presented itself as a vehicle for the feelings of hope and despair called forth by contemporary events.",2022-04-06 17:09:38+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4887,,,1573,0,18,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.881840261696328e+18,,"Golgotha, 1921 Ilya Repin, 1844.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a Crucifixion without Christ, whose body has already been removed from the place of execution, leaving yawning emptiness at the center of the painting. Two dead thieves remain, tied to their crosses. A third cross rests on the ground, its nails, its crossbar, and the surrounding area saturated with Christ’s blood. With brutal realism, Repin depicts a pack of carrion dogs licking the blood; one, positioned at the foot of the empty cross, looks out of the painting as if in response to the viewer’s presence. The desolate feeling of emptiness created by Christ’s absence is countered by a pinpoint of light in what appears to be his tomb in the background, outside the city wall.

Its top contains a large birds-nest, in which there is a bird, and a single egg. Branches rise up from the nest, one of which passes in an arc to the right, where it terminates in some sort of flower. Another bird sits on a horizontal branch. The rest of the surrounding countryside is more conventional. The land drops to a couple of lakes, with a woman washing clothes in the further of them. It then opens out into pastures with pale bleaching fields, behind which a track curves to a church with a tower, set in a belt of trees. The sky is almost free of cloud, with some small wisps only. However the light appears flat, without distinct cast shadows. As Hieronymus Bosch’s namesake, St Jerome occupies a significant place in his work. He represented him on several occasions. He considered the saint a role model, both as a scholar and because of his relentless moralism and his personal dedication.",2022-04-05 18:43:50+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4852,,,721,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.938547634028416e+18,,314549@2x.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jerome lies on a rock located under a kind of shell-like cave. He is surrounded by his traditional symbols (the lion - although in this case it has a smaller size than usual - the galero, the Bible), but Bosch, as common in his works, also added some bizarre elements, such as the bony pig or the spherical shell emerging from the pool. This could symbolize the world floating towards decay. An owl, and another recently discovered little owl watching the first one, are depicted on a branch: they allude, respectively, to heresy and the struggle against heresy. The Ten Commandments tables can be seen above the cave.",2022-04-05 18:39:38+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4848,,,720,0,10,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the course of the Peloponnesian War, Alcibiades changed his political allegiance several times. His allies welcomed his assistance, but of course his frequent changes of allegiance left him with many enemies and few friends. In 404 BC, his residence was surrounded and set on fire.

Rubens, although closely allied to Isabella and the Spanish Netherlands, often had occasion to travel and visit foreign monarchs in his position as a court painter. Rubens lobbied for an end to the Thirty Years' War with considerable passion and cleverness. The painter sought to bring Spain and England, traditional enemies, to peace in the hopes that the Spanish would then pressure the Dutch into following suit. During this period Rubens carried messages, demands, and concession agreements back and forth between Phillip IV and Charles I to ultimately reach a conclusion. This unique position as both a master painter and trusted diplomat clearly informed our painting, which shows the artist's sincere desire for peace and his justified horror at how war has ravaged Europe. His diplomatic work allowed him and burdened him with considerable knowledge of the state of the continent and the consequences war had wrought.",2022-04-04 21:48:18+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4772,,,542,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/png,5.934044034401044e+18,,1385202631-the-consequences-of-war---1637---1638.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rubens's women bear a striking resemblance to Titian's Venus with a Mirror and Nymph and Shepherd. However Titian's most famous work, Venus of Urbino, undoubtedly inspired Rubens's depiction of her in Consequences of War. The similarity between the two portraits of the goddess is unmistakable. Rubens's debt to Annibale Carracci lies at least in part in his composition. The densely populated drama of Consequences of War recalls Carracci's Loves of the Gods, in particular The Triumph of Bacchus. Furthermore, the careful use of color, light, and shadow as opposed to line to show space used by Carracci in Flight into Egypt became a key part of Rubens's style. Indeed, Rubens's style became a highly coloristic one.",2022-04-04 21:44:02+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4770,,,526,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Viewers note the influence of Michelangelo in Rubens's interest and brilliance in depicting the human form. Consequences of War contains not only Rubens's trademark women but also the well muscled forms of Mars, Alekto, and the architect. These muscular figures are reminiscent of the powerful specimens depicted in Michelangelo's Last Judgment, David, and The Creation of Adam.

It was painted for Ferdinando II de' Medici. Although commissioned by an Italian, art historians characterize both the work and the artist as Flemish Baroque. It serves as a commentary on a European continent ravaged by the Thirty Years' War, and the artist employed numerous symbols, both contemporary and ancient, to deplore the state of the continent. Rubens painted Consequences of War between 1638 and 1639 in response to the Thirty Years' War. The conflict's origins are complex and diverse but animosity between Protestants and Catholics played a significant role. In addition, struggles for political power in Europe contributed to and prolonged the war. The fighting led to the destruction of large areas of Europe as well as outbreaks of both pestilence and famine. Much of the fighting took place in the German states which suffered significant depopulation as a result.",2022-04-04 21:29:11+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4761,,,1824,0,17,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this a supernatural group of hunters pass an observer, in wild pursuit of unseen quarry. The hunters can be spirits of the dead, or mythical figures such as elves, fairies, or Valkyrie-like horsewomen/men. The leader of this wild hunt is often an Odin-like individual, although different cultures vary this by citing semi-historical or legendary heroes. When people see the Wild Hunt pass by, it’s supposed to be the harbinger of some catastrophe, or a portent of the death of those who witness it.

He then followed the boy to kneel beside the tiny hole, watching him spill out a few meager drops. “My child,” the bishop of Hippo broke the news gently, turning the boy’s skinny shoulders to face the sea. He then spread his own arms wide, “You could never fit this great, magnificent ocean into that tiny hole!” The child didn’t flinch, but responded quickly: “And you could never possibly understand the Holy Trinity.” Then in a flash, the boy disappeared.",2022-04-03 21:32:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4714,,,747,0,10,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.904529942560901e+18,,39533459-d24e-471f-9f9a-e6c4006271f6.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was frustrated, having taken a break from working on what’s become known as one of his greatest doctrinal contributions to the Church, De Trinitate, or “On the Trinity.” The subject matter had left him bleary-eyed – in need of fresh air. It was in this moment, as the frothy tide rushed out, that a little boy caught St. Augustine’s eye. The freckle-faced child had a determined, furrowed brow. He was clearly up to something, running back-and-forth, back-and-forth, between the sea and a tiny hole in the ground. “My son,” St. Augustine called over the crashing waves, “What are you doing there?”",2022-04-03 20:27:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4712,,,718,0,9,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.904529942560901e+18,,''Vergós_Group_Saint_Augustine_Meditates_on_the_Trinity_when_the.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The artist has chosen realistic seeing with a backdrop that is relaxing without being invasive. In fact, he subdues the background with his use of brushstrokes. The area is indistinct to an extent. This forces the person looking at the painting to keep their focus on the to women in the foreground. He is not exploring them from a complete global view but instead has chosen to focus on elements associated with Greek and Roman culture. His use of color soothes the senses. It also invites onlookers to focus on the expressions of the figures in this painting. In his effort to call attention to each discipline in a personal way, the artist invites greater contemplation of the effect of Art and Literature on society.

With his son Ascanius at his side, he carries his old and infirm father Anchises on his shoulders. Anchises clutches the penates, the household gods. In the narrative Aeneas' wife Creusa here set in the margin of the composition, would be lost and killed in the confusion of the flight. This subject found a new popularity at the end of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth centuries, notably through the enthusiasm of Cardinal Scipione Borghese. The connections, emphasized by Virgil and Ovid, between the flight of Aeneas and the founding of Rome had obvious appeal to the modern Romans.

The Coliseum is found in both series, while the Lighthouse of Alexandria is only found in the engraving series. Rantwyck mainly follows the prototypes, however he changes certain aspects to render the fantasy-like atmosphere. He arranges the seven monuments in prominent positions within the general organization of the paintings. Moreover he adds episodes from the history of the monuments themselves through the presence of main characters, ‘macchiette’ (figurines) and an enchanting landscape.

The painting's title alludes to multiple things, most notably the myth of Psyche and Cupid and the type of large mirror depicted on the left, wherein one can see oneself fully. A full-length mirror with chassis was invented in the late eighteenth century and took its name, psyché, from the aforementioned legend of Cupid and Psyche, a story that thematizes looking. Yet this is not an actual psyché but an easel with a mirror where the canvas would normally sit, an analogue to a psyché suggesting that art is a reflection of life.

Here, however, the psyché is placed on an easel, where a canvas is supposed to sit. The young woman, like Psyche to Cupid in the ancient tale, peers stealthily around the edge of the mirror to the viewer. In this painting, Psyche looks both into the mirror and, via the latter, at the viewer. A cloth partially covers the mirror, hiding the reflections of the studio.

By 1650, the Grand Condé had fallen out of favour at court, and with the Regent Anne of Austria in particular, who had him arrested early that year for participation in the Fronde civil wars. He was pardoned in the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, which formally ended the Franco-Spanish War, and accepted the authority of King Louis XIV. On returning from exile, the Grand Condé was received by the king at Versailles in 1674, following his military victory at the Battle of Seneffe against William of Orange. Here the Grand Condé is slowly ascending the steps between laurel wreaths of victory, and captured enemy standards at the edges, bowing with respect at the king before him.",2022-03-30 18:25:27+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4575,,,653,0,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some argued that the two crowns, resembling royal and ducal insignia, represented the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania respectively. In 1927, duplicate crowns were made of pure gold, donated by the people, and were blessed by Pope Pius XI. On 2 July 1927 the Canonical Coronation took place and the painting received the title of Mother of Mercy. The gold crowns were lost, possibly during World War II.

The motto Malo mori quam foedari (better to die than be defiled) placed beside a short-tailed weasel suggests that he may be a knight of the Order of the Ermine. A number of hypotheses have been advanced regarding the identity of the figure; the last one suggests that he may be the Venetian capitano Marco Gabriel. With regard to the identity of the figure depicted here, the first suggestion was that of Saint Eustace, which was popular saint in France and Germany. The idea was based on the presence of the deer next to the lake, suggesting one of the saint’s traditional attributes: a deer with a crucifix in its antlers.",2022-03-28 19:50:38+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4529,,,540,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From some time until the 20th century the painting had been given the monogram of Albrecht Dürer, and Carpaccio's signature had been overpainted. The realism and detail of Carpaccio does in fact show Northern influence. The painting shows a young knight, surrounded by a rather crowded series of symbols. The heron caught in the sky by a hawk might hint at this knight's death in battle, also alluded to by his posture, which recalls that of a funerary statue; an alternative theory is that this is a memorial portrait of a person already dead. The other knight with a lance might then be the same person during his life.",2022-03-28 19:41:19+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4528,,,539,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This piece by Leonardo Alenza is highly ironic and criticises the Romantic excesses of his contemporaries. Despite this, the painting is full of typically Romantic characteristics. For example, the theme: suicide. It appears as the only way out for Romantics from the mal du siècle, that is, the eternal dissatisfaction caused by the process of revolutions and changes in their society. In the composition there are very Romantic allegorical objects. Some of them are the inkwell and quill pen, the writer, several books and a skull.

The blessing refers to this firstborn status but also condemns Reuben for betraying his father in an earlier incident, when, as related in Genesis 35, Reuben slept with Jacob’s concubine Bilhah. Zurbarán’s depiction of Reuben reflects these conflicting circumstances. The column, a traditional symbol of fortitude, on which Reuben rests his hand, as well as his frontal stance, suggests his strength and rank in the family.

In 1756, all but one of the paintings passed into the hands of Bishop Richard Trevor of Auckland Castle, County Durham. Naphtali is a doe let loose that bears lovely fawns. “The Blessings of Jacob” (Genesis 49:21) Like Issachar, this statuesque figure is depicted in the humble clothing of a laborer. Barefoot, he wears a voluminous brown robe and red undergarment, with a red cap over his abundant dark hair. The son of Jacob and Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid, Naphtali is equated in Jacob’s blessing with “a doe let loose.” Zurbarán, however, chose to ignore this reference, depicting him instead as a farm worker rooted to the earth, with a muscular physique and a spade to tote over his shoulder.",2022-03-28 16:18:14+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4484,,,506,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two similar series are found today in Lima, Peru, and Puebla, Mexico, respectively. However, the original destination of the present set is not known, leaving Zurbarán’s purpose in creating these monumental paintings, as well as their early history, wrapped in mystery. Attired in the finest regalia, the prosperous farmer Asher was the son of Jacob and Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid. In Zurbarán’s painting, the overflowing basket of bread in Asher’s hands refers to the “royal delicacies” in the blessing and showcases the artist’s extraordinary skill in the genre of still life. Asher’s association with bread in biblical literature led the sixth-century Spanish theologian Isidore of Seville to interpret him as a prefiguration of Christ, who in the Eucharist becomes bread for the faithful.",2022-03-28 16:13:43+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4482,,,538,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In seventeenth-century Spain, it was commonly believed that the indigenous people of the New World were the descendants of the ten lost tribes.

The imagery is closely connected to the blessing.

Jacob’s sons were the offspring of four women: his two wives, Leah and Rachel, and two concubines, Bilhah and Zilpah. With Leah, Jacob also had a daughter, Dinah. “The Blessings of Jacob,” the prophetic poem from Chapter 49 of Genesis, was Zurbarán’s primary biblical source for Jacob and His Twelve Sons, painted in the 1640s. In these verses, Jacob gathers his sons around him just before his death to reveal their destinies.

At last, as if overcome by his persistence, she exclaimed, ‘You are invincible, my son!’ and when Alexander heard this, he declared that he wanted no other prophecy…” Such is the scene that Louis-Jean-François Lagrenée re-creates in his painting, featured above. It shows Alexander the Great dragging a priestess, known as a Pythia, towards a statue of Delphi’s patron god, Apollo. The scene likely is set right around the time when the priestess complained that pushy Alexander was invincible, or perhaps incorrigible.",2022-03-26 22:26:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4437,,,988,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.879888718751337e+18,,IMG_20220317_002117.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alexander’s visit to Delphi sparked a curious legend, and the odd story was later recorded by the prolific biographer, Plutarch. As the story goes, Alexander had the bad luck of arriving at Delphi on a day when the Oracle was closed due to religious law and customs. The young king, the legend tells, was such an impetuous and headstrong person that, rather than wait a day or two for the Oracle site to resume its operations, Alexander instead barged into the complex and forcefully compelled the priestess to deliver a divine message, despite the religious laws forbidding her from carrying out her duties on that day.",2022-03-26 22:23:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4436,,,1704,0,17,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She jumps ahead, after having hit the sounding cymbals, the third; and I would dare to say that she dances to be admired."" This is how Gioachino Rosini, a friend of Canova, describes the dancer with cymbals which, in fact, unlike the previous ones, totally relies on space as in jumping a living body relies on air.

Light and graceful ballerinas flutter against the dark background of these paintings, the closefitting clothing lets the beautiful underlying shapes shine through in a suffused sweet light. Canova welcomes the challenge of transferring the specific qualities of dance, movement and temporal succession, to figurativity, through very different techniques, passing from tempera painting to sculpture, theoretically conceived as static art. The tempera must be considered one of the stages of the Canovian reflection on the characters of the graceful genre that began with monochrome drawings, passed to color, was then practiced in terracotta and plaster models, and finally landed in statuary. The resulting sculpted dancers represent joyful and serene girls while they dance, surprising for the lightness of the bodies and the naturalness of their movements.",2022-03-26 09:25:08+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4413,,,809,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, Canova’s entire artistic journey was imbued in the research for beauty, elegance, and lightness. His series of paintings on dance proves it. He focused on it mostly during the occupation of Rome by French troops (1798-1799), when he returned for a couple of years to Veneto, where he was born, and started to sketch goddesses, damsels and cherubs in graceful dance positions.

Like other fifteenth-century Flemish painters working in the wake of Jan van Eyck, Hans Memling cloaked religious imagery in the pictorial language of everyday life, paying close attention to naturalistic detail. This Annunciation takes place in a comfortably appointed bedchamber, though many of the domestic furnishings have symbolic connotations. The carafe of water, through which light passes uncorrupted, and the vase of lilies are symbols of the Virgin's purity, while the empty candleholder signifies her imminent role as bearer of Christ, light of the world. Gabriel's priestly garb alludes to the ritual of the Mass and, therefore, the incarnation of Christ.

Géricault's raft pointedly lacks a hero, and his painting presents no cause beyond sheer survival. The work represents, in the words of Christine Riding, ""the fallacy of hope and pointless suffering, and at worst, the basic human instinct to survive, which had superseded all moral considerations and plunged civilised man into barbarism"". The unblemished musculature of the central figure waving to the rescue ship is reminiscent of the Neoclassical, however the naturalism of light and shadow, the authenticity of the desperation shown by the survivors and the emotional character of the composition differentiate it from Neoclassical austerity. It was a further departure from the religious or classical themes of earlier works because it depicted contemporary events with ordinary and unheroic figures.",2022-03-25 12:25:07+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4391,,,615,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.893257474475036e+18,,JEAN_LOUIS_THÉODORE_GÉRICAULT_La_Balsa_de_la_Medusa_Museo_del_Louvre.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pictorial composition of the painting is built upon two pyramidal structures. The perimeter of the large mast on the left of the canvas forms the first. The horizontal grouping of dead or dying figures in the foreground forms the base from which the survivors emerge, surging upward towards the emotional peak, where the central figure waves desperately. The viewer's attention is first drawn to the centre of the canvas, then follows the directional flow of the survivors' bodies, viewed from behind and straining to the right. Two other diagonal lines are used to heighten the dramatic tension. One follows the mast and its rigging and leads the viewer's eye towards an approaching wave that threatens to engulf the raft, while the second, composed of reaching figures, leads to the distant silhouette of the rescue ship.",2022-03-25 12:20:08+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4390,,,605,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The makeshift raft is shown as barely seaworthy as it rides the deep waves, while the men are rendered as broken and in utter despair. One old man holds the corpse of his son at his knees; another tears his hair out in frustration and defeat. A number of bodies litter the foreground, waiting to be swept away by the surrounding waves. The men in the middle have just viewed a rescue ship; one points it out to another, and an African crew member stands on an empty barrel and frantically waves his handkerchief to draw the ship's attention. Géricault's palette is composed of pallid flesh tones, and the murky colours of the survivors' clothes, the sea and the clouds. Overall the painting is dark and relies largely on the use of sombre, mostly brown pigments, a palette that Géricault believed was effective in suggesting tragedy and pain.",2022-03-25 12:14:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4386,,,582,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As he had anticipated, the painting proved highly controversial at its first appearance in the 1819 Paris Salon, attracting passionate praise and condemnation in equal measure. However, it established his international reputation and today is widely seen as seminal in the early history of the Romantic movement in French painting. Its insistence on portraying an unpleasant truth laid the foundations of an aesthetic revolution. Géricault's compositional structure and depiction of the figures are classical, but the contrasting turbulence of the subject represents a significant change in artistic direction. Although The Raft of the Medusa retains elements of the traditions of history painting, in both its choice of subject matter and its dramatic presentation, it represents a break from the calm and order of the prevailing Neoclassical school.",2022-03-25 12:10:05+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4385,,,628,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is an over-life-size painting that depicts a moment from the aftermath of the wreck of the French naval frigate Méduse, which ran aground off the coast of today's Mauritania on 2 July 1816. At least 147 people were set adrift on a hurriedly constructed raft; all but 15 died in the 13 days before their rescue, and those who survived endured starvation and dehydration and practiced cannibalism (the custom of the sea). The event became an international scandal. The event fascinated the author, and before he began work on the final painting, he undertook extensive research. He interviewed two of the survivors and constructed a detailed scale model of the raft. He visited hospitals and morgues where he could view, first-hand, the colour and texture of the flesh of the dying and dead.",2022-03-25 12:04:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4384,,,758,0,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lion-scalp trim on Decius Mus’s boots, his armor with its torso-molded breastplate ornamented with griffins, and even the lappets on his skirt adorned with alternating lion and human heads were all drawn from historic sources. Rubens was profoundly influenced by the ancient philosopher Justus Lipsius’s writings about the great Stoic philosopher, Seneca, who hailed Decius Mus a model for military and political leadership due to his constancy, virtue, and nobility. Rubens underscored these Stoic ideals by placing Decius Mus on a marble dais whose square shape emblematized fortitude.",2022-03-23 23:17:16+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4308,,,487,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.89992974052911e+18,,decius_mus_addressing_the_legions_1957.14.2.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This panel depicted the first episode of that story, which normally consisted of seven or eight scenes. In his History of Rome, Livy describes an episode in the war between the Romans and the Samnites, the inhabitants of the plains of Latium, against their Roman rulers in 340 BC. The Roman forces led by co-consuls Decius Mus and Titus Manlius were outnumbered and in danger of defeat when an apparition visited them both at night and declared that victory would come to the army whose leader lost his life. Decius Mus, thus, vowed that he would sacrifice himself to ensure Roman victory. Rubens depicts Decius Mus recounting the apparition to his soldiers the following morning.

At the heart of the story is the agonizing relationship of Renzo and Lucia, the betrothed couple, who are swept apart by political intrigue and circumstance. It follows the hapless pair in their seemingly hopeless quest to be reunited, a storyline which will remind American readers of Longfellow’s Evangeline. Against the backdrop of petty tyranny and political turmoil, and amidst the mayhem of revolutionary mobs and the miasma of plague-ridden streets, the story of the lovers is interwoven with the stories of great sinners and even greater saints. Its greatest strength, however, is the menagerie of multifarious characters that Manzoni presents to the reader, a motley medley of all that is best and worst in humanity. https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2019/04/betrothed-greatest-novel-ever-written-joseph-pearce.html",2022-03-23 14:30:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4278,,,621,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This latter claim will come as a surprise to those who might not even have heard of Manzoni’s classic work. Alessandro Manzoni was a revert to the practice of the Catholic faith, having wandered off as a young man in pursuit of the fashionable and anti-Catholic secularism espoused by the followers of Voltaire. Having returned to the Catholic faith with a renewed vigour and fervour, he began writing religious poetry and authored a scholarly treatise on Catholic morality. It was, therefore, as a devout Catholic that Manzoni set to work on The Betrothed, his own muse being betrothed to the essential truths that the novel shines forth.",2022-03-23 14:28:59+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4277,,,631,0,12,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ancient carnyx was a wind instrument of the Iron Age Celts, used between c. 200 BC and c. AD 200. It was a type of bronze trumpet with an elongated S shape, held so that the long straight central portion was vertical and the short mouthpiece end section and the much wider bell were horizontal in opposed directions. The bell was styled in the shape of an open-mouthed boar's, or other animal's, head. It was used in warfare, probably to incite troops to battle and intimidate opponents, as Polybius recounts. The instrument's significant height allowed it to be heard over the heads of the participants in battles or ceremonies. The word ""carnyx"" is derived from the Gaulish root, ""carn-"" or ""cern-"" meaning ""antler"" or ""horn,"" and the same root of the name of the god, Cernunnos.",2022-03-23 00:33:26+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4268,,,1895,0,10,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The strong horizontality of the composition, achieved with the prominent placement of the structural façades, emphasizes the dynamism of the scene: the figures are moving forward across the picture plane towards a destination. This plane intersects with the vertical elements Rockwell places throughout the canvas, such as the church steeple and the figures themselves, giving the composition an overall balance.

However in typical Rockwellian fashion, the artist elevates the picture far beyond a simple genre scene, creating a compelling and convincing image of small town America. Employing Johannes Vermeer’s iconic painting View of Houses in Delft (Fig. 1) as a compositional inspiration, Walking to Church demonstrates Rockwell's ability to imbue a scene with the particulars of a complex narrative, transforming a single static image into a dynamic ongoing story. In Walking to Church Rockwell depicts his figures marching determinedly down an average city street lined with residences and businesses. The beauty parlor, barber shop, and restaurant are closed for the day; the members of the family appear to be the only residents of this city who have ventured out of their homes to greet the day.",2022-03-23 00:02:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4261,,,475,0,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here the lighting plays a fundamental role: that of the moon is echoed by Vengeance's torch, and Justice, a severe à l'antique figure, carries a sword and the scales judgement, judgement having already been passed. Prud'hon used quick, sweeping strokes of paint to lend movement and energy to the figures. Strong contrasts of light and dark accentuate the drama of the situation. Light from the moon illuminates the faces of the avenging personifications and highlights the torso of the dead man, while the face of the murderer is cast in darkness. Inspired by the Roman poet Horace's adage that ""retribution rarely fails to pursue the evil man,"" Prud'hon conveyed the message that the course of justice is relentless if sometimes slow.",2022-03-22 22:23:06+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4220,,,1246,0,9,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.89542528190828e+18,,0000375496_OG.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The painting shows four protagonists: Themis (Justice), Nemesis (Divine Vengeance), Crime, the Victim, and it's remarkable for its dramatic eloquence. The aim of the work, given its proposed siting, was to strike the emotions, to “give a commotion to the soul”, as Prud'hon put it: “Divine Justice” he went on, “is forever pursuing crime; and crime never gets away. Wrapped in the veil of night, in a remote and wild place, voracious Crime has killed a victim, taken his gold and is turning to see whether any remains of life might give him away. Fool!

The poem, which paid homage to Queen Elizabeth as the personification of Gloriana, was probably considered eminently suitable as a subject during the reign of a new female monarch, while its themes of chivalry and nationalism suited the Victorian taste for 'olden tymes'. In this scene from Book I of The Faerie Queene, Una appears in the centre, her white costume identifying her as the personification of truth and ideal beauty. The composition closely follows the text, as 'wooddy nymphs', hamadryads and naiads flock to see Una's lovely face but then run away for fear of being humiliated by her 'heavenly grace'. Meanwhile the satyrs on the left, usually renowned for their lascivious nature, become overawed by Una's beauty and 'henceforth nothing faire, but her on earth they find'.",2022-03-20 23:12:19+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4136,,,510,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proclamation of the king says in part: ""We, respecting the many labors, dangers, and adventures which you underwent as stated above, and so that there might remain a perpetual memorial of you and your services and that you and your descendants might be more fully honored ... it is our will that besides your coat of arms of your lineage, which you have, you may have and bear as your coat of arms, known and recognized, a shield...""",2022-03-20 05:50:05+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4103,,,765,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tigers are symbols of power, but often gullible and targets of rabbits, who are clever tricksters. The tiger symbolizes the strong; the rabbit symbolizes the weak, and the rabbit has to rely on intelligence, in order to not be eaten by the tiger, similar to the lion/bear and fox European tales. However, in these particular paintings, rabbits have the meaning of fertility, abundance, and prosperity. In the Chinese zodiac, the tiger represents January, and the rabbit represents February. The rabbit celebrates the tiger because he took up the first month, and so the story inside the paintings mean hope for a abundant and prosperous new year.",2022-03-19 23:25:47+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4099,,,783,0,25,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead of tight lacing and bustles, Leslie portrays the softer, more free-flowing aesthetic which was gradually coming into fashion. This representation is more in keeping with the aesthetic tastes of Oriental China, which was particularly admired in Britain in the 1870s and 80s. Leslie underscores this cultural interest through the women’s dress, the flowers, and the blue and white vases, The vases depicted, however, have been identified as Western reproductions in the Chinese style rather than originals. Of his artwork, Leslie once said: ""My aim in art has always been to paint pictures from the sunny side of English domestic life, as much as possible to render them cheerful companions to their possessors. The times are so imbued with turmoil and misery, hard work and utilitarianism, that innocence, joy and beauty seem to be the most fitting subjects to render such powers as I possess useful to my fellow creatures.""",2022-03-19 23:03:41+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4096,,,598,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.886590130453482e+18,,COL_GAG_695-001.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The title’s “moonflowers” refers to the two young women depicted.

Loki was then fastened to three rocks in the cave with the entrails of his slain son, which the gods had turned into iron chains. Skadi placed a poisonous snake on a rock above his head, where it dripped venom onto his face. But Loki’s faithful wife, Sigyn, sat by his side with a bowl that she held up to the snake’s mouth to catch the poison. But every so often, the bowl became full, and Sigyn would have to leave her husband’s side to dispose of its contents, at which point the drops that fell onto the unrepentant god’s face would cause him to shake violently, which brought about earthquakes in Midgard, the world of humanity. And this was the lot of Loki and Sigyn until, as fated, Loki will break free from his chains at Ragnarok to assist the giants in destroying the cosmos.",2022-03-18 22:17:18+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/4052,,,653,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.884429160608173e+18,,lossy_page1_2752px_Loke_and_Sigyn_Mårten_Winge_Nationalmuseum_18041.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The woman looks as though she loves these gifts, and moans sweetly. The knight puts the lady up on his horse and rides all day without taking his eyes off her. As the lady delicately rides his horse side-saddle, as befits a lady, she sings a ‘faery’s song’. As if to complement the three gifts (garland, bracelets, ‘zone’ or girdle) the knight gave her, the belle dame sans merci gives the knight three sweet gifts: sweet relish, wild honey, and manna-dew (implying something almost divine: ‘manna’ was the foodstuff that fell from heaven in the Old Testament). In a strange language, the lady tells the knight she loves him. She takes him to her Elfin grotto, where she proceeds to weep and sigh; the knight silences her with four kisses.",2022-03-17 11:51:00+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3998,,,632,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Crane - La belle Dame Sans Merci (1865) The Beautiful Lady Without Mercy is one of John Keats’s best-loved and most widely anthologised poems. Keats’s title, which he got from a 15thcentury courtly love poem by Alain Chartier, provides a clue to the poem’s plot: in summary,the poem begins with the speaker asking a knight what’s wrong – this knight-at-arms is on his own, looking pale as he loiters on a hillside. This knight-at-arms has a lily-white forehead, and a rose-coloured cheek. But symbolically, this rose is withering: love has gone rotten. It’s at this point that the voice in the poem shifts from this first speaker – the one questioning the knight about what’s up with him – to the knight-at-arms himself. The knight then tells us his story: he met a beautiful lady in the meadows, who the knight believes was the child of a faery – there was something fey or supernatural and otherworldly about this woman. She had wild eyes, which imply an unpredictability in her nature.",2022-03-17 11:48:15+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3997,,,625,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many critics were repulsed by the shocking contrast between the melancholy beauty of Sigismunda and the grotesquely bloody organ that she delicately touched. It was said that Hogarth placed an attendant next to the painting to note the remarks made by the viewers; changes to the painting suggest that he may have responded to these criticisms by altering his work, although it is impossible to ascertain whether many of the changes were made before or after the painting was exhibited. A piece of paper draped over the edge of the table is clearly visible in outline, despite having been painted over with detailing of the table itself. It is also known that, to attempt to appease critics, Hogarth repainted the fingers of Sigismunda so that the blood that was previously there would no longer be visible.",2022-03-17 01:04:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3978,,,510,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.879888718751337e+18,,Hogarth_sigismunda.jpeg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seated at an ornate wooden table, wearing a pearl tiara and flowing silk, is Sigismunda (called Ghismonda in Boccaccio's original tale), the heroine of one of the novelle. It is probable that Hogarth modelled her on his wife, Jane. She clasps a golden goblet containing the heart of her murdered husband, Guiscardo. Guiscardo was a servant and page in the court of Sigismunda's father, Prince Tancred of Salerno. When Sigismunda's father discovered that Guiscardo and Sigismunda had wed secretly, he angrily ordered his men to murder the low-born Guiscardo, and had Guiscardo's heart delivered to Sigismunda in a golden cup. Despite having committed to die without shedding a tear, she weeps as she realises her father has murdered her husband.

This is a stylised background, painted to evoke the landscape of ancient Greece or Rome. The story comes from the Aeneid, by the Roman poet Virgil. The Trojan military leader Aeneas wants to visit the Underworld in order to consult the ghost of his father. He meets the Cumaean Sibyl (a priestess at Cumae, a Greek colony near Naples, Italy). She agrees to guide him through the kingdom of the dead. The deep lake, surrounded by dark woods, was believed to lead to the Underworld. Turner based the Italian setting of this painting, with its view of Lake Avernus, on a drawing by his patron, Sir Richard Colt Hoare.",2022-03-17 00:03:43+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3943,,,525,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The figures of Mary Magdalene and Christ dominate the foreground, while the two other Marys arrive at the tomb to meet the angel who tells them that Jesus has been resurrected. Although this scene has been reproduced many times in the history of art, Fontana’s painting is unusually warm and tender in comparison to other depictions of the same moment, which usually have a more formal air. Christ stands in a casual pose; his body forms an S shape, one of the characteristics of the Mannerist style. He is barefoot and wears a wide-brimmed hat and a simple tunic. This humble attire is a reference to a preceding passage in which Mary mistakes Jesus for a gardener. As noted above, the image has an affective bent. This is a characteristic of Mannerist art, which relies on pathos to communicate its message, as opposed to the serene, unemotional paintings of the Renaissance period.",2022-03-16 23:43:29+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3937,,,546,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the x-ray one can see that Holbein originally intended that Christ and Mary Magdalene should face each other squarely across the centre of the picture. He then heightened and enlarged the position of Christ to give him more dominance over the startled Magdalene. Another is that originally the Apostles were running towards a wicket gate, with a wooded landscape behind. In the final painting the trees were made into the city of Jerusalem towards which Peter and John rush with no impediment of a gate to an enclosed garden. The trees have been identified: on the left an elm, centre a hawthorn and on the right a larch. The meticulously painted myriad of plants at the feet of Christ and Mary have also been identified and both trees and plants have been interpreted as reinforcing the story because of their associations with for example healing, spiritualism, majesty, death, the Crucifixion and the Resurrection.",2022-03-16 23:33:53+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3934,,,550,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.879888718751337e+18,,254901-1589893731 (2).jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It seems likely that this work was painted between 1526 and 1528 during Holbein's first visit to England. It is painted on oak (which the artist did not use in Basel) and stylistically it conforms to Holbein's style at this date. An anonymous Noli me Tangere appears in the inventories of Henry VIII, but Holbein did not work directly for the King until his second visit to England. The ointment jar held by Mary has been compared with contemporary French earthenware (from Saint Porchaire, for example) but it appears closer to the wares produced in Antwerp at the time and there is no reason to doubt that it is an object of Holbein's own design.",2022-03-16 23:30:07+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3933,,,562,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Light is crucial to the narrative. Silhouetted against the dawn sky on the left are numerous crosses on the hill of Calvary. Also lit and isolated at the centre of the scene are the hands of Christ and the Magdalen. The dawn light has yet to reach the inky darkness above the figures and while Christ's face is in full light, Mary's face is in half shadow, increasing the sense of confusion expressed in her eyes. A confusion, showing doubt and sadness which will soon be replaced by the clear dawn light and the certainty of the Resurrection. In the interior of the tomb, which radiates an ethereal light, are two seated angels, blanched by the strength of the light and one of the them gazes directly at us.",2022-03-16 23:23:03+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3931,,,616,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Holbein's unusual depiction focuses on the moment when the mourning Magdalen, having found two angels in the empty place of Christ's body at the tomb, turns and encounters a man whom she takes to be a gardener. The majority of Holbein's religious paintings were intended as large altarpieces. This is a smaller, more intimate narrative scene. Mary Magdalene pivots dramatically, her right hand outstretched as though to prevent collision with the man before her. Christ in turn holds out both arms to stop her progress, seemingly in an attempt to soothe her before the moment of recognition. The result is a graceful pas de deux. The colours of her dark cloak and red robe are reversed in the figure of Christ so that the two become negatives of one another.",2022-03-16 23:17:03+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3928,,,807,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At times arrogant and self destructive, he was also a gifted intellectual and friend to politicians, such as Robert Peel, and the poets William Wordsworth and John Keats. Unimpressed by much of the work around him, he determined to revive the art of painting historical, mythological and biblical subjects on a grand scale. Constantly short of money and frustrated by lack of recognition, he was also forced to paint conventional portraits and scenes from everyday life. After a long struggle against the establishment, Haydon and his allies persuaded central government to become directly involved in the patronage of art through publicly funded training and the commissioning of frescoes in the House of Commons. However, his failure to gain a commission came as a bitter blow and he became increasingly despondent. On 22 June, 1846 he committed suicide.",2022-03-15 17:26:08+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3899,,,580,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.8753054904303e+18,,unnamed (16).jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He is mentioned shortly by Varro and at length by Livius. After an earthquake in 362 BC, a huge deep pit suddenly opened in the Roman Forum, which the Romans attempted to fill in vain. Despairing, they consulted an augur who responded that the gods demanded the most precious possession of Rome. The Romans doubted the warning, and struggled to think of what that was. However, a young soldier named Marcus Curtius castigated them and responded that arms and the courage of Romans were the nation's most precious possessions. Astride his horse, fully and meticulously armed and decorated, Marcus rode and leapt into the chasm. Immediately, the deep pit closed over him, saving Rome. This painting depicts a mythical deed of self-sacrifice inevitably identified with the artist's own story and act of suicide.",2022-03-15 17:16:00+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3898,,,933,0,8,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cooling wine and the chair positioned as if to receive a visitor suggest that the theme of the painting is seduction. But who is the lady seducing? Through her reflection in the mirror she glances directly at the viewer, who might be seduced as well by the beautiful surface of the painting.

He is no ordinary craftsman, but an artist whose intellectual works are the means by which he will triumph over his own mortality. The painting's illusionism is enhanced by the objects on the window ledge -- the plaster cast, the book, the sash -- that seem to project into the viewer's space. The emphasis on Dou's artistry is intended both to delight and to prompt speculation about the relationship between the real and the represented worlds. Dou has clearly situated himself in an artist's studio, as is evident from the easel, the figure on the table behind him, the plaster cast on ledge, and the palette and brushes in his hand. Like his costume, many of the objects in the painting carry connotations related to the ideas of studium and vanitas.

When Philip IV took the throne in 1621 he was only sixteen years old, and he delegated a considerable part of his work as ruler to Olivares, who was then thirty-four and had proved to be a very skilled politician with an extraordinary capacity for work. From then on, the latter´s power grew, and by the 1630s, it had reached a very high level indeed. The Count-Duke had a notable iconographic presence as the subject of portraits by extremely important artists, including Rubens and most of all, Velázquez, who became his protégé when he settled in Madrid.

In full armor and holding a baton, he is shown as a victorious commander. His horse holds a dressage position known as a levade. Here, Velasquez is not only depicting the Count-Duke of Olivares; he is also transmitting the fact that he is not a king, but instead, the king's favorite. Olivares is depicted in a foreshortened position that brings a sense of violence and dynamism to his likeness. Those qualities are further emphasized by his attitude. Rather than looking undauntedly forward, he casts his energetic and arrogant gaze directly upon the viewer, and the same qualities are also underlined by the manner in which the rider and his steed occupy almost the entire foreground.

The Gothic-style church is built on an even smaller scale than the models of domestic spaces, emphasizing the grandeur of the space. Thorne did not set out to create a “typical” church space but rather one with specific character and exquisite details. She lavished attention on even the smallest elements of the space, specially commissioning the elaborate altarpiece, grille work, and crucifix from artists who generally worked in full scale. The Gothic style of the church would have been familiar to her Chicago viewers—after the Great Fire of 1871, the city embraced the Gothic Revival style for churches, universities, apartment buildings, hotels, and private clubs.",2022-03-12 23:21:13+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3799,,,491,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The painting was produced during an important time in Swedish history. The establishment of modern Sweden coincided with the introduction of Protestantism and the break-up with Denmark and the Kalmar Union. The painting was commissioned by the Swedish reformer Olaus Petri, and the resulting controversies between him and King Gustav Vasa and the historical context remained a well-kept secret for centuries. During the 20th century the painting became an icon for the history of Stockholm and it is now frequently displayed whenever the history of the city is commemorated.

According to the passage in the Vasa Chronicle, however, both Petri and the master of the mint Anders Hansson were sincerely troubled by the appearance of these sun dogs. Petri interpreted the signs over Stockholm as a warning from God and had the Vädersolstavlan painting produced and hung in front of his congregation. He therefore saw it as his duty to warn both his congregation, mostly composed of German burghers united by their conspiracy against the king, and the king himself. The king's interpretation of the phenomenon, however, was that no significant change was presaged, as the ""six or eight sun dogs on a circle around the true sun, have apparently disappeared, and the true natural sun has remained itself"".",2022-03-12 22:47:59+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3793,,,479,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By 1909 he had abandoned conventional portraiture in order to ""experiment with more imaginary fields."" The woman in Repose is Sargent's niece, Rose–Marie Ormond. In keeping with his newfound preference for informal figure studies, Sargent did not create a traditional portrait; rather, he depicted Rose–Marie as a languid, anonymous figure absorbed in poetic reverie.

For her beloved, she sings the famous tune: ""Do you know the land where the lemon tree blooms?"", which is an invitation to go and live in Italy, her native country. Scheffer did not stray from Goethe's text. Mignon is young, shapely, she has long, brown hair, slightly curly. She goes barefoot because Goethe portrayed her as being close to nature. ""Mignon regretting her homeland"" is very simple: a vast arid landscape, rare vegetation, a cloudless blue sky, a flight of migrating birds, a discreet allusion to Mignon's desire to go to another country.

The background landscape, whose crags are seemingly replicated in Anne's veil, virtually melts in its sfumato haze. The baby lamb is both a symbol of innocence and of Jesus' sacrifice for humanity, memorialized in John the Baptist's reference to Jesus as the ""Lamb of God"". Leonardo's painting is at once both pleasing, calm yet confusing upon closer examination. Upon closer examination of their positioning it is apparent that Mary is sitting on Saint Anne's lap. It's unclear what meaning this could have and what meaning Leonardo intended to project with that pose. There is no clear parallel in other works of art and women sitting in each other's lap are not a clear cultural or traditional reference. Additionally, it can be extrapolated from the painting that Saint Anne is significantly larger than Mary.

Poussin's earliest biographer, Giovan Pietro Bellori, understood the 'I' of the phrase to refer to Death, thus making the painting a memento mori, reminding the viewer that even in the blissful utopia of Arcadia, death still exists. Another biographer, André Félibien, interpreted the 'I' to refer to the occupant of the tomb, but still took the overall meaning of the painting to be a reminder that death is present even in idyllic Arcadia.",2022-03-07 18:57:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3614,,,713,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She retreated to a solitary existence in a moated house. She is still in love with Angelo – now Deputy to the Duke of Vienna – and longs to be reunited with him. In the picture the autumn leaves scattered on the ground mark the passage of time. Mariana has been working at some embroidery and pauses to stretch her back. Her longing for Angelo is suggested by her pose and the needle thrust fiercely into her embroidery. The stained-glass windows in front of her show the Annunciation, contrasting the Virgin's fulfilment with Mariana's frustration and longing.

The ladies are shown engaging in various activities such as reading, writing, or playing musical instruments. The women all share the same heart-shaped face and gentle demeanor. The expressions of the female figures are characterised by their sweetness and grace. The Master clearly expressed in these works the high artistic and moral humanistic values of the Northern Renaissance. The figures are typically placed in a wood-panelled interior or against a neutral background.

Delacroix, despite his reservations about their literary merit, repeatedly found inspiration in these writings. This picture, painted in 1846 and exhibited in the Salon of that year, illustrates an episode from Scott's Ivanhoe, in which the beautiful Rebecca is carried off by two Saracen slaves at the command of the Christian knight who has long coveted her. Contemporary critics, including Baudelaire, praised the work's spontaneity and power. Vivid colours, the contorted, interlocking poses and compacted space, which shifts abruptly from the elevated foregound to the fortress behind, create a sense of intense drama. Apart from the still life at lower left, the only element of calm is Rebecca herself.",2022-03-05 06:30:50+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3524,,,766,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Excellent craftsmanship marks the painting of the thoughtful, mystic face of the young girl in her curious, Old-World garments. A native of Nantes, Maxence was always faithful to Brittany and throughout his career he found inspiration in Breton legends and customs. He was also drawn to the Catholic faith of his home region and closely studied liturgical costumes, church interiors, and the traditional dress of peasant churchgoers. Reverie is an exceptional example of the symbolist religious paintings completed by Maxence just before and directly after World War I. The works in this cycle usually feature a single female figure in a church interior praying or reading a devotional book. Elements of the present composition can be found in other works of the period: the figure’s reflective, downward gaze; the medieval-style black headdress; the gold choir screen.",2022-03-02 22:40:41+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3453,,,698,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although critics and theatregoers were divided over Terry’s characterisation, they were united on visual impact of her performance. Her costume created an ethereal vision that ‘might have stood in the court of Camelot’. Oscar Wilde, noting the contrast between her dress and the austere garb of the male cast, quipped ‘Lady Macbeth seems an economical housekeeper, and evidently patronises local industries for her husband’s clothes and the servants’ liveries; but she takes care to do her own shopping in Byzantium’. Subsequent years were hard on the dress, which survived international tours and Terry herself, with her reputation for arriving late and dressing in haste. It was restored in 2011, after 1,300 hours of conservation work over two years and a cost of £110,000.",2022-02-26 19:39:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3383,,,735,0,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sargent admired her performance and costume and convinced her to pose for him. He shows Terry placing a crown on her head after the murder of Duncan, the Scottish king. The incident does not occur in Shakespeare’s text, nor was it a part of the performance. Sargent, however, sought a dramatic motif to make his portrait convincing, both as the personification of a role and as the characterization of an individual actor. Terry’s intense and powerful gaze enhances this climactic moment. Alice Comyns Carr, a close friend of the artist, designed Terry’s spectacular costume, using green silk and blue tinsel adorned with thousands of beetle wings to make the actor look like a serpent. Sargent captured the iridescent effect with impressionistic dabs of pigment.",2022-02-26 19:27:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3380,,,719,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.810184345884824e+18,,IMG_20220221_142618.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is also the symmetrical focal point with atmospheric perspective around the subject, a radial balance of light arranged around a central element, and dramatic contrasts with dark colours on the periphery. Copernicus's epiphany or ecstasy is captured through the use of quasi stage lighting. The location depicted by Matejko is fictional. Modern scholars are still looking for the exact location of the Copernicus observatory, and agree that Matejko's portrayal was more of a ""romantic vision"".

The arch represents moral probity emphasised by the symbolism of the sunflower (constancy), the grapevines (domestic virtue) and the weeping cherub (chastised profane love). Once in the room, the viewer is confronted by a host of vanitas objects: a lute with a broken string, a skull intertwined with a vine, a candle with the flame extinguished, and a jewellery box with its lid wide open. These all signify the transient effects of misdirected sensual pleasure. Even the act of pulling on a stocking had a clear message; namely that impetuous behaviour such as pulling on a stocking too quickly could result in its being holed, just as yielding to sensuality could lead to ruin. Steen implies that to pass through the arch would be to risk the loss of virtue. There is, therefore, a sense in which the interior amounts to pagan love and the exterior to spiritual love.",2022-02-24 17:42:19+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3340,,,683,0,7,1,PeerChannel,1561395949.0,ThirstForBeauty,2021-10-18 16:53:01,2021-10-18,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/783,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A young woman is shown partially undressed, with an unlaced jacket, putting on a stocking. A lapdog lies on her unmade bed, by which there is a chamber pot, and her shoes are scattered on the floor. The figure is alluring and looks straight out at the viewer with an inviting expression. Seduction is her intent. The viewer, however, is kept out of the room itself, which lies beyond an imposing arched doorway imbued with classical features. Two columns with Corinthian capitals rest on bases decorated with cartouches, whilst the arch itself is adorned with swags and a weeping cherub. There is a marked and deliberate contrast between the interior and the exterior, to the extent that this is clearly to be read as an allegorical painting.",2022-02-24 17:42:19+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3339,,,718,0,7,1,PeerChannel,1561395949.0,ThirstForBeauty,2021-10-18 16:50:06,2021-10-18,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/782,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The original rows of pearls on the equatorial band of the globe have been lost. In the center of one side of the cross is a notch from late antiquity; the other two sides are largely identical. In the ancient world, the shape of the sphere had a triple meaning: it was an image of the ""cosmos"", the earth, but also a symbol of the concept of universal power. The imperial orb, with its detached cross, thus represents the reign of Christ over the four parts of the world known at the time.

On his head is a richly wrought gilt helmet with ear-pieces and a plume of short white and red feathers. Dark background. Strong light falls from the left at top on tin helmet and, touching the face as it passes, on the breast. Life size, half-length. The sitter is identified as Rembrandt's brother Adriaen. But as Adriaen was a poor shoemaker in Leyden while Rembrandt lived in Amsterdam, and as moreover Adriaen van Rijn died in 1652 while this model occurs in pictures of the year 1654, the identification is not very probable.""",2022-02-21 11:58:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3294,,,785,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.800870584749394e+18,,1528px_Rembrandt_circle_The_Man_with_the_Golden_Helmet_Google_Art.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dark background and the only weakly lit face of the man result in the helmet becoming the visual focal point of the picture. The colour of the helmet, its elaborate décor and the strong lighting accents in this area of the painting emphasize the helmet as a valuable part of a military armament. The personality of the wearer is pushed into the background. Formerly attributed to the Dutch painter Rembrandt, today it is considered to be a work by someone in his circle. Doubts were expressed as to its provenance in 1984 by a Dutch curators' commission specifically created to investigate Rembrandt works of questionable authenticity. Important details in the painting's style did not match the style of Rembrandt's known works, and so the painting was probably painted in 1650 by one of Rembrandt's students.

The art techniques used in both versions is the Trompe-l'œil style which seems to allow characters to move in their gestures, as a means to grab the attention of the observers. This difference possibly reflects the circumstances of Caravaggio's life at that point (he had fled Rome as an outlaw following the death of Ranuccio Tomassoni), or possibly, recognising the ongoing evolution of his art, in the intervening five years he had come to recognise the value of understatement.",2022-02-20 03:20:07+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3275,,,765,0,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The unexalted humanity is apt for this scene, since the human Jesus has made himself unrecognizable to his disciples, and at once confirms and surmounts his humanity.

Yet classical coherence is simultaneously undermined by a series of dramatic and jarring juxtapositions: light abuts shade, color distorts line, gesture contradicts pose. The formal and rhetorical tensions of the painting likewise drew polarized commentary when it first appeared at the Royal Academy in 1781. Some critics likened it to the sublime rhetoric of Longinus, while others lamented what they described as the ungraceful, even vulgar composition of the painting's main figure. Fuseli’s Dido is - both literally and figuratively - a body divided. Dido's figure is disrupted not only by the suicidal act that forms the dramatic center of the story, but moreover by the formal juxtapositions and figural shifts in the painting.

The composition is completed on the opposite side on the left by the figures who are clearly suffering from the effects of the wine, and here Bruegel depicts those who have been carried away by the sin of gluttony rather than following the path of virtue, in contrast to Saint Martin. Examples of such figures include one vomiting, another lying unconscious in his own vomit on the ground, two men fighting and the woman offering her baby wine.",2022-02-16 12:04:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3218,,,745,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.784960432452144e+18,,Brueghel_The_Wine_Of_Saint_Martins_Day_Private_Collection_Madrid.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 11th of November, the saints feast day, was celebrated by eating Saint Martins Goose, coinciding with the autumn pig-killing, while the new wine made from the recently picked grape harvest, known as Saint Martíns wine, was sampled. The coincidence of the saints feast day with the end of the grape picking meant that Saint Martins Day became associated with a free distribution of wine to country people outside city gates. As a result, and despite the presence of Saint Martin in the painting, dividing his cloak on the right, this is not a religious composition or a devotional work, nor, however, is it a genre scene.

Looking closely at the painting by Bellini, there is an obscure seventh crown embroidered in the draped fabric in the forward-most portion of the painting. In the past, the seven crowns were suggested as defining Mehmed's position in the Ottoman dynasty. Another portrait probably made in Venice around c.1510 of Mehmed seems to show that the seven crowns were not of significance, at least not in the way past historians thought they could have been.

All the people here accuse you and curse you, but Brother Wolf, I would like to make peace between you and the people.” He then led the wolf into Gubbio, and surrounded by astonished locals, Francesco made a pact between the townspeople and the animal. As the wolf had been driven by hunger to do evil, the citizens would feed the wolf regularly so that it was no longer hungry. In return, the wolf would no longer attack them or any of their animals. The deal even extended to the local dogs, who would not trouble the wolf again. As a mark of this agreement, and so that the townspeople could recognise ‘their’ wolf, Francesco blessed it. The hero of this brief legend is, of course, the future Saint Francis of Assisi, and perhaps the source of the story as the Fioretti or Little Flowers, a compilation of such tales which grew after the saint’s death in 1226.",2022-02-12 05:29:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3171,,,699,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.769505782911472e+18,,Luc-Olivier_Merson_-_Le_Loup_d'Aggubio.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Around 1206, Gubbio, perched on the lower slopes of the Apennine Mountains in central Italy, was troubled by a predatory wolf. It was winter, and the wolf was driven by hunger to feed not only from local flocks of sheep, but had started to attack people too. Living in the town at the time was a young man from Assisi, Giovanni di Pietro di Bernardone, known to everyone as Francesco. He seemed to have a way with animals, and when he heard of the rising concerns about the wolf, he decided to go up into the woods and pastures to find it. He had trudged for some distance over the snow-covered hills when he came face to face with the beast.

Soon she was named Augusta and became, effectively, the ruler of the empire. She now began to fear John’s power— who was the patriarch of Constantinople, may have been the only man in the empire strong enough to oppose her. After John’s sermon on the vices of women (in 401), Eudoxia conspired with Bishop Theophilus of Alexandria to depose John. A few days after John was put out of the city, however, an earthquake shook the region, damaging the imperial bedroom. Terrified of God’s evident wrath, Eudoxia begged John to return, affirming her regard for him and remembering his baptism of her son. But more intrigue (and perhaps an indirect attack on Eudoxia by John in one of his sermons), ended the short truce. John was again sent into exile.

The exterior painting is less well preserved, with scratchings and paint losses on important passages. It is painted on a single board of oak, with a vertical grain. Although the painting is quite flat, perspective is achieved through the subtle fall of light which creates distance between the rear wall and framing arch.

It is rather static and sculptural, with any action limited to the main characters positioned in the center of the panel. The scene is set within a domed apse-like building, as an altarpiece takes center stage it is presumably a church. The Virgin stands to the left, to her right is Anna the Prophetess and behind her, only partially visible is St. Joseph, who holds the sacrificial doves. Simeon is dressed in green and appears quite regal, although he appears to be crying, perhaps because he knows the tragedy that awaits Christ in later life. He holds the Christ child, the stained glass behind them shows a representation of Moses holding the Tablets of Stone.

February remained the last month of the calendar year until the time of the decemvirs (c. 450 BC), when it became the second month.

This image was used as the basis for coins and seals. The portrait was painted around 1600 –1610 and it was based on an original painting (now lost) which dated from Elizabeth’s coronation in 1559. Elizabeth is wearing a dress decorated with Tudor roses and fleur-de-lis. The fleur-de-lis is a reference to the English claim to French soil. Elizabeth has long flowing hair in this portrait, which is traditional for the coronation of a queen, perhaps also as a symbol of virginity. The fabric of her dress is made from woven gold and silver silk thread. The lining of her robe is ermine, with each black dot being the tail of one animal.

Warfare was a semantic element of the Achaeans especially till the middle of the 13th century BC when the geographical territories/boundaries of the several small Kingdom-states situated in South Greece were stabilized. The archaeological findings reveal that during the 15th century BC the military industry in Peloponnese was flourishing side by side with the growing commercial economy and complexity of the Mycenean society. Luxurious imported decorative goods from the Middle East, impressive tombs, palaces etc. prove that the society was in great motion driven by ambitious rulers. Armors, as valuable signs of military superiority and high ranking possessings became essential part of the everyday life of ruling elites.",2022-02-06 10:59:50+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3080,,,657,0,4,1,PeerChannel,1393682270.0,GreekLeague,2021-09-13 07:00:09,2021-09-13,https://t.me/GreekLeague/1706,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we see Ariadne deserted and in a tragic pose. According to an Athenian version, Minos (King of Crete, son of Zeus and Europa) attacked Athens after his son was killed there. The Athenians asked for terms and were required to sacrifice 7 young men and 7 maidens to the Minotaur every 7 or 9 years. One year, the sacrificial party included Theseus, the son of King Aegeus, who volunteered to kill the Minotaur. Ariadne, daughter of Minos, fell in love with the Athenian hero Theseus at first sight, and gave him a thread or glittering jewels, to help him escape the Labyrinth after slaying the Minotaur, a beast half bull and half man that Minos kept in the Labyrinth. Here the legends diverge: she was abandoned by Theseus and hanged herself; or, Theseus carried her to Naxos and left her there to die, and she was rescued by and married the god Dionysus.",2022-02-04 19:52:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3055,,,764,0,10,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The painting shows the three-quarter-length portrait of a young woman wearing a precious, exquisitely tailored dress in blue damask fabric with subtle gold embroidery and slashed sleeves in burgundy velvet to show the white fabric puffs of the blouse underneath, and a fur draped over her right hand with casual elegance. This nonchalance is mirrored in the way the woman's face captures the observer's attention, as its features adhere to the precise aesthetic canons of the Italian Renaissance such as a high forehead, slender eyelashes, vibrant gaze and black eyes, pale cheeks daubed with red, breast radiant with the colors of the moon and the honey-colored hair styled in knotted braids.",2022-02-02 23:42:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/3036,,,856,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The painting was received to near universal acclaim and made Bryullov the first Russian painter to have an international reputation. The subject is the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 that enveloped the city of Pompeii in volcanic ash killing most of its inhabitants. As a scene from the ancient world it was an appropriate subject for a history painting, then regarded as the highest genre of painting, and the magnitude of the event also made it suitable for a large canvas that would allow Bryullov to showcase all his skills.

In this painting Millais depicts this subject as it was described in a poem by John Keats (1819). Millais shows the heroine in the act of undressing for bed, suddenly transfixed by a sense of awe at the significance of the occasion. Keats based his poem on the superstition that a girl could see her future husband in a dream if she performed certain rites on the eve of St. Agnes; that is she would go to bed without any supper, undress herself so that she was completely naked and lie on her bed with her hands under the pillow and looking up to the heavens and not to look behind.

In the context of Velázquez's development as an artist, The Waterseller exhibits the beginnings of the technique found in the artist's mature creations. His insight into the person of the seller is symptomatic of his insight into the subjects of his great portraits, and his precise rendition of the small details of reality demonstrate his understanding of human perception. Also within the painting, the old man and the young boy both touch the same glass though they don't ever make eye contact.

The seller has two customers: a young boy, and a young man in the background shadows. In the foreground sit the seller's gigantic pots of water, glistening with splashes of water. So large and rounded, they almost protrude out of the painting into the observer's space. The seller hands a freshly poured glass of water to the boy. In it sits a fig, a perfumer intended to make the water taste fresher (something still done in Seville today). It is not known for sure, but it is assumed that the painting is being taken place either within a tavern or near one. The lighting enters the scene from the left and is brings attention to the young boy and to the water droplets on the pot of water.

Her relics, believed to be genuine, are preserved in the church of S. Cecilia in Trastevere, Rome, which is of very early foundation. According to legend, she rejected the sound of musical instruments that greeted her as she went to her wedding, saying that she had ears only for the celestial music that required her to be stainless in body and soul. Ever since this story gained currency in the 15th century, she has been cast in the role of music's patron saint, often being shown playing an organ or other instrument. In Appleyard's picture, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1903, the Saint has fallen asleep at her organ, watched over by a guardian angel and surrounded by such appropriate symbols as an open book of devotion and a discarded jewel-box.",2022-01-22 03:13:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2899,,,992,0,14,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rubens uses a similar metaphor, creating a heavenly glory around the Virgin in the likeness of the rising sun.

Later he became involved in divination and the occult, seeking to talk to angels through the use of scryers (those who divine the future), who used artifacts—like mirrors and crystals.

The vivid contrasts of darkness and light enhance the almost unnatural beauty and Gothic elegance of the model. Van der Weyden was preoccupied by commissioned portraiture towards the end of his life and was highly regarded by later generations of painters for his penetrating evocations of character.

Therefore this is a representation that recognises Mary as the woman of the Sacred Scriptures and also the fact that she is closely bound to her Son’s redemptive mission. The Child Jesus sits on his mother’s lap and He is dressed in a red tunic that is the same colour as that of His mother. This concordance is a symbol of the fact that Mary would also share in Her Son’s passion. It evokes the words of Simeon: “and you yourself a sword will pierce” (Lk 2:35). Looking closely at the Child we can see that He holds a Rosary that finishes with a rose and he wears a distinctive coral coloured necklace that is an ancient sign of protection from danger. In this way the esteem the Lord has for the rosary prayer is visualised as if through this prayer He is communicating with His mother. They are surrounded by the angels who form and adoring line that encircles them.,2022-01-17 02:55:05+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2850,,,793,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.974269920706301e+18,,cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Virgin is enthroned with the crescent moon at her feet which symbolises her Immaculate Conception. The crescent moon, which represents the lunar phases that are used to measure time, depicts that fact that she was chosen “outside time” or in the “fullness of time” (Gal 4:7) to be the Mother of God and so was conceived without original sin. In addition, she brought into the world the Lord who stepped into human history from eternity and therefore from outside time. The moon at her feet and the fact that behind her we can see that she appears brighter than the sun are a reference to the Book of Revelation where it is written: “A great sign appeared in the sky, a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet..” (Rev 12:1-2).",2022-01-17 02:50:03+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2849,,,800,0,8,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sweet yet pert woman kneeling in the confessional was thought by some contemporary critics to represent a young mother who had yielded to the advances of an admirer. Meticulously captured in all the details of furnishing and dress, the contemporary scene was instead seen by the Catholic critic Pietro Estense Selvatico as designed to illustrate the moral beauty of everyday life. Giuseppe Molteni thus developed a type of genre painting then in great demand on the market, depicting aspects of society and day-to-day life in a variety of styles ranging from folksy and anecdotal to dramatic in subjects of social satire.",2022-01-16 02:16:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2842,,,964,0,20,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was the virgin goddess of war, but unlike her counterparts Mars or Bellona, she was neither belligerent nor cruel. Her inventive strategy led to victory and she was therefore, paradoxically, also the goddess of peace. She was also the goddess of wisdom, art, poetry, medicine and crafts, especially those of spinning and weaving. Rembrandt van Rijn was fascinated with biblical and mythological subjects such as Minerva, and he firmly believed that depictions of them and their stories comprised the most significant of all genres of painting. As with Minerva, Rembrandt’s goddesses and heroines of the 1630s share her statuesque appearance and have similarly full, blushing faces with heavy eyelids. It is not surprising that they were all at some time believed to portray Saskia Uylenburgh, whom Rembrandt married in the summer of 1634.",2022-01-15 10:57:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2835,,,705,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.974269920706301e+18,,RR-107-Rembrandt_van_Rijn-Minerva_in_Her_Study.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Waterhouse depicted Rosamund wearing a crown, maybe as an indication that it is not Rosamund's position in the King's affection that Eleanor found threatening but her challenge as a rival queen. If we look away from Rosamund we can see the curtain being parted by Eleanor, the wronged wife, about to enter with murderous intent.

An individual bearing the wounds of Stigmata is referred to as a Stigmatist or a Stigmatic. The term originates from the line at the end of Saint Paul’s Letter to the Galatians where he says, “I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.” Stigmata are primarily associated with the Roman Catholic faith. Many reported stigmatics are members of Catholic religious orders. St. Francis of Assisi was the first recorded stigmatic in Christian history. For over fifty years, St. Padre Pio of Pietrelcina of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin reported stigmata which were studied by several 20th-century physicians.

Girodet, who had become famous at the 1793 Salon for his extremely strange picture, The Sleep of Endymion (Musée du Louvre), was an innovative painter, both in subject matter and style. Neoclassicism and romanticism: Girodet used a traditional composition of Christian iconography, The Entombment, for this canvas. Yet, in the manner of his master, David, his figures are aligned in a frieze-like manner and his drawing is precise. The dead Atala is somewhat unrealistically portrayed as an ideal beauty, and Girodet reuses the chiaroscuro effect of The Sleep of Endymion: the light caresses Chactas’ back and Atala’s bust and lips. The picture, foreshadowing romanticism, is steeped in sensuality, emotion and religiosity, and the scene’s exotic setting and vegetation are a far cry from David’s austere decors.",2022-01-07 21:19:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2757,,,691,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.947282725630119e+18,,graves.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This painting in particular is supposed to have achieved heights of singular elegance.

For many years, the painting was on display in the Tribuna degli Uffizi, close to the Medici Venus, probably as an intended comparison between the two provocative beauties: the classic, idealized ancient statue, and the modern, carnal painting by Titian.

It was a ceremony held in the home and not in church, during which a young woman whose hand was requested in marriage would touch the hand of the groom to express her consent. Titian takes this as his inspiration for a seductive Venus, using an iconography that began in the early Renaissance, inspired by the ancient depiction of the “Venus pudica”.",2022-01-04 21:46:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2707,,,3023,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He distinguished himself among his brethren by rigorous mortification, profound humility, and extraordinary simplicity. While gathering alms, Saint Salvator of Horta often came upon sick people for whom his prayers were requested. He would make the Sign of the Cross over them, and immediately they were healed. News of this fact soon spread abroad and may sick were brought to the convent. All were restored to health through the Sign of the Cross which Brother Salvator made over them. The concourse of sick people, however, finally became so great that it disturbed the good order in the convent. So the superiors sent Brother Salvator to the nearby convent of Horta, where he spent the greater part of his religious life; hence his surname “of Horta.”",2022-01-03 22:13:03+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2689,,,623,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was created from the fire of the sun god Ra’s eye when he looked upon Earth. Ra created her as a weapon to destroy humans for their disobedience to him and for not living in accordance with the principles of Ma’at (the goddess of truth, justice, balance, and most importantly - order). Sometimes she is seen as the daughter of Geb (earth), and Nut (the sky). Sekhmet was depicted with the body of a woman with a lion head wearing a sun disk. She was seen as the protector of the pharaohs and led them in warfare. When she was in a calmer state she would take the form of the household cat goddess Bastet. Sekhmet was a terrifying goddess, however for her friends she could avert plague and cure disease. She was the patron of physicians and healers.",2022-01-03 08:21:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2677,,,708,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thou need’st not to be gone."" ""Farewell, farewell, one kiss, and I'll descend"": Act Ill, Scene V.

The painting was commissioned by Count Giovan Battista Sommariva and presented in Milan at the annual exhibition of Fine Arts in Brera in 1823. It is the first important literary theme addressed by Francesco Hayez, who was inspired by a sixteenth-century novel by Luigi Da Porto - History of two noble lovers - and, above all, by the famous tragedy of William Shakespeare. The painting, which imposed Hayez as the leader of the nascent Italian Romantic painting, was an extraordinary success thanks to the novelty of the subject and the pictorial language, capable of combining a lively chromatism of Venetian origin with a careful rendering of the details of the environment. The purchase of this work represented a fundamental turning point in Sommariva's collecting activity, hitherto oriented towards more rigorous neoclassical tastes, showing his openness to the new instances of romantic art.",2022-01-02 16:58:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2653,,,1133,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imitating the human body was therefore the artist's highest vocation, and it was the closest art that could reach God. But this notion of ""imitatio"" - as the masters of the Italian Renaissance understood and practiced it - came to have a specific meaning that transcends the concept of imitation as a copy. Whether the artist worked from live models or not, he certainly surpassed and idealized what he was facing. The bodies of these figures pulsate with life, but it is life poured into a sculpture as in a drawing. These monumental figures embody the artist's unique talent in assimilating classical models and the first model of nature - that is, the human body made in the image of God - in a process that combines memory and invention. As a glorious declaration of their ambition, the figures not only imitate nature, but seek to improve it, a process for which Michelangelo would become the paradigm among his contemporaries and subsequent generations.",2022-01-01 21:24:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2631,,,1261,0,16,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elizabeth Jane Gardner Bouguereau depicts a young David kneeling victoriously on a dead lion while clutching a lamb in the crook of his right arm. As he gazes to the heavens, he gesticulates upward with his left hand toward the source of his strength. The monumental composition and David’s pose reflect Bouguereau’s familiarity with old-master paintings and classical sculpture. David’s marble-like skin stands out against a background of muted blues and earth tones, further contributing to the otherworldliness of this representation. The polished surface of the work, which Bouguereau achieved with smooth, unbroken brush strokes, conveys the idea that this is a historic moment frozen in time.",2022-01-01 12:53:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2611,,,657,0,8,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was an American expatriate who died in Paris where she had lived most of her life. She studied in Paris under the figurative painter Hugues Merle, the well-known salon painter Jules Joseph Lefebvre, and finally under William-Adolphe Bouguereau. After Bouguereau's wife died, Gardner became his paramour and after the death of his mother, who bitterly opposed the union, she married him in 1896. She adopted his subjects, compositions, and even his smooth facture, channeling his style so successfully that some of her work might be mistaken for his. In fact, she was quoted as saying, ""I know I am censured for not more boldly asserting my individuality, but I would rather be known as the best imitator of Bouguereau than be nobody!""",2022-01-01 12:47:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2610,,,3123,0,19,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rather than commit their entire armies to the field, the Spartans and Argives agreed that the battle would be fought by 300 soldiers from each side, and whichever side won would possess the land. Othryades was one of 300 Spartan soldiers selected to fight, and was the last one to survive the battle. Ashamed by surviving his comrades, he committed suicide on the field following the battle. Just before he died, he engraved the victory on his shield. The lively modeling expresses the tension of his body in a final surge of pride. The statue is a model that Sergel, a Swedish sculptor who had made his name in Rome, presented to obtain admission to the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in Paris in January 1779. With the plaster model in the Louvre Museum, there is another terracotta statuette in the Nationalmuseum, Stockholm. There is no known marble version of this work.

Rather like a still from a movie scene, a maid opens the door to the living room, her hand remains on the door handle. She appears concerned, waiting to see the response to the unexpected visitor. A second person, probably the cook, curiously peers over the maid's shoulder. A slightly disheveled man steps across the floorboards, clutching his cap. He is wearing and scarf and a long woollen coat with sleeves that are much too long. His boots seem well worn and this, along with his thin beard and gaunt face, gives him a more weary look. The figure seems slightly hesitant, and his eyes are apprehensive, he is unsure what to expect.",2021-12-29 18:11:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2575,,,794,0,11,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.14311.user.ThirstForBeauty.post.2569,1561395949,ThirstForBeauty,2569,,"Jean-Baptiste Poncet prefers a melancholic vision of Orpheus. He represents the inconsolable loss of Eurydice. On the Rhodope mountains, Orpheus retires to play the lyre, with which he manages to enchant all creatures, even the wildest and most ferocious. Here a tiger licks his feet, the lion seems almost moved by the pain of Orpheus, turning towards his figure. Orpheus, in the center of a pyramidal composition, stands in contrast to witness an impeccable academic career. A tear flows discreetly on the poet's face, reinforcing the dramaturgy of the scene. Likewise, the chromatic scale reduced to dark tones accentuates the sense of despair that overwhelms the young man. All the criteria for the success of an academic work are collected here: choice of a mythological subject, clear and structured composition, mastery of anatomy, subordination of color to drawing. All these resources will allow Jean-Baptiste Poncet to win the 3rd class medal at the Salon of 1864.

For my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the sight of all people, a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel” (Luke 2:29-32). You can almost hear the relief in his voice, for he is at peace. His tired, old eyes have seen the Lord’s salvation. His weary arms have held the Prince of Peace. Though Jesus has yet to be visited by the Magi, step into the Jordan River, do battle with the devil in the wilderness, drive out any demons or diseases, or preach on the Mount; though He has yet to be betrayed, arrested, scourged, crucified, and laid in the tomb – it is as good as done.

They are in front of the steps that leads to the high priest’s throne. What is most striking about this picture is the light. Everywhere else in the painting, the people are in shadows. But there is a light upon Simeon and the holy family. If you look closely, the light is not shining upon the Infant. Rather, the light is coming from the Infant!

It was designed to occupy the right-hand side of the altarpiece for the high altar of the church of San Pedro Mártir in Toledo and was located on the lower level of that ensemble. The restrained, earthy palette of the Adoration of the Shepherds here becomes a profusion of colours that immediately conveys the richness and exoticism of the Magi, representatives of the powers of three continents who prostrate themselves before the newborn Infant and offer gifts that bear witness to the special nature of Christ: Aurum regi, thus Deo, myrrha defuncto. Maíno conceived his presentation of the episode through a composition that is notably simple with regard to spatial structure and the placement of the figures and other elements. However, the characters transmit enormous warmth and emotion, and they relate to each other in an effective manner by virtue of Maíno’s dazzling use of the brush.",2021-12-26 13:09:38+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2456,,,1084,0,11,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.929285670198577e+18,,Maino-adoracion_reyes.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, at a closer glance, one observes that this vertical beam intersects with the horizontal shelf to form a cross. It thus foreshadows the Crucifixion as it proclaims the Incarnation at the same time. The Virgin wears no halo or celestial attribute. Her hands humbly clasped, her head tilted upwards and her eyes focused. She is clearly receptive and open to God’s will. Domesticity is now no stranger to epiphany. Peeking below her cascading drapery one finds Mary’s bare foot. This is an unusual Marian symbol, rarely found in classical depictions of the Annunciation. But for Tanner, it signified the humanity and simplicity of the Blessed Virgin. The colors of the composition further embellish the liturgical and artistic beauty of the painting: red symbolizes love, white signifies purity, blue stands for wisdom, and gold is reminiscent for divinity.",2021-12-25 19:42:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2433,,,484,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The orderly arrangement of the room, in contrast to her bed, suggests that Mary has suddenly been awakened in the middle of the night.

Most obvious are three themes, of the season of spring, flowers and gardens, and metamorphoses. If we cannot bind the stories together into a coherent whole, then we must accept that, like many of Poussin’s favourite books such as Tasso’s Jerusalem Delivered, we are looking at an epic compilation of stories with the common themes of death, and re-birth through metamorphosis.

Ghirlandaio’s representations of women are subjected to an aesthetic compromise that favours idealistic stylization and the decorative unity of the whole. The delicate balance of form and the harmony of the chromatic combinations reveal that the artist aspired towards an ideal of order as a principle of composition. This phenomenon corresponds to a generalised trend towards humanism art. A beautiful example of the portraits of the Quattrocento, the figure is shown in three-quarter profile against a neutral background, befitting the practise that prevailed before landscape began to be introduced as background. The figure is cut off a little below the shoulders and the face, although depicted without excessive attention to detail, reveals a search for naturalist figuration, a desire to ‘create the real’.",2021-12-24 11:15:06+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2344,,,576,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The meaning of the name Demeter Thesmophoros still remains a matter of disagreement, although a possible translation is “bringer of treasure or wealth,” an obsolete sense of thesmos. Or, the name Thesmophoria is perhaps the primary one, from which the epithet of the goddess was derived; it means “the carrying of things laid down.” The celebrants were free women who seem to have been married. They observed chastity for several days & abstained from certain foods. The festival lasted three days, in Attica it was lengthened to five. The original days were Pyanopsion (October) 12–14 and were called respectively anodos (or kathodos), nēsteia, and kalligeneia.

The two gods are shown on a natural arch of rocks in front a symbolic bed; in the background the vegetation has many fruits in the right part (the male one) and only one in the left (female) part, symbolizing the fecundation. The posture of Venus derives from the ancient sculpture. They are accompanied by Anteros (the heavenly love), opposed to the carnal one. The latter is still holding the arch, and has a blowpipe which aims at the genitals of Vulcan, Venus' husband, portrayed in his workshop in a grotto.

The date of the battle has traditionally been said to be 496, though other accounts suggest it may either have been fought as early as the 480s or as late as 506. The site of ""Tolbiac"", or ""Tolbiacum"", is usually given as Zülpich, North Rhine-Westphalia, about sixty kilometers east of what is now the German-Belgian frontier. Clovis is considered the founder of the Merovingian dynasty, which ruled the Frankish kingdom for the next two centuries, a kingdom that included most of Roman Gaul and parts of western Germany; to the French, he is the founder of France. The Battle of Tolbiac is seen as an important step in his consolidation of power, but his subsequent conversion to Catholicism was at least as politically and historically important.",2021-12-20 20:55:07+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2263,,,2357,0,9,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lady Godiva appealed again and again to her husband, who obstinately refused to lower the taxes. At last, weary of her entreaties, he said he would grant her request if she would strip naked and ride on a horse through the streets of the town.

Caesar had been appointed to a governorship over a region that ranged from southern Gaul to Illyricum (but not Italy). As his term of governorship ended, the Roman Senate ordered Caesar to disband his army and return to Rome. He was explicitly ordered not to take his army across the Rubicon river, which was at that time a northern boundary of Italy. In January of 49 BC, Caesar brought the 13th legion across the river, which the Roman government considered insurrection, treason, and a declaration of war on the Roman Senate. According to some authors, he is said to have uttered the phrase ""alea iacta est""—the die is cast—as his army marched through the shallow river. Today, the phrase ""crossing the Rubicon"" is a metaphor that means to pass a point of no return.",2021-12-19 21:58:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2248,,,563,0,11,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Simply after Zeus permitted Persephone to quickly leave the nation of shadows and come back to her mom once per year, Demeter then changed her indignation to leniency. Leighton represents at the right Persephone’s pale body rising out of the underworld, where she was condemned to spend part of each year among the dead. Head flung back, arms extended beseechingly, she is supported by Hermes, the messenger of the gods, who wears a blue cloak and red-winged hat. On the left, Demeter, goddess of the harvest and agriculture, greets her daughter with open arms. The reunion of Demeter and Persephone was associated with renewal and the changing of the seasons, evoked here by the warm blue sky and the sprig of almond blossom at Demeter’s feet.",2021-12-18 04:06:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2195,,,557,0,11,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Art historians have written of the work's distinctly stage-managed character: items are arranged as if they are props, while the dramatic lighting increases the impression that a play is being enacted. In addition to the mysterious subject-matter, this stage-like effect is presumably one of the chief reasons why scholars have repeatedly tried to identify a literary source for the painting. Various Naturalist novels have been put forward for consideration. Georges Rivière, a friend of the Impressionists, first suggested Louis Edmond Duranty's novel, the ""Struggle of Francoise Duquesnoy"", as a source, but the idea was found unsatisfactory. Later, a scene within Émile Zola's ""Madeleine Férat"" was identified as matching the elements of Degas's painting in several particulars—but while the narrow bed and the round table corresponded, the position of the figures relative to each other did not.",2021-12-17 17:19:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2171,,,498,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.884409141765606e+18,,2560px-Edgar_Degas_-_Interior_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The theatrical character of the scene has led art historians to seek a literary source for the composition, but none of the sources proposed has met with universal acceptance. Even the painting's title is uncertain; acquaintances of the artist referred to it either as Le Viol or Intérieur, and it was under the latter title that Degas exhibited it for the first time in 1905. Degas painted Interior at a time when his growing commitment to Realism had led him away from his earlier preoccupation with historical subjects.

His genre scenes were reminiscent of the style of the Le Nain brothers. The painter was virtually unknown until the discovery in the early 1990s of a painting bearing his full signature. Since then his oeuvre has gradually been reconstituted. Willemsens has further been identified with the anonymous master previously referred to as the Master of the Béguins. This notname was given to this anonymous master active in Paris in the mid 17th century because he often depicted beguines. The style of this master's works were grouped because of their subject matter and their closeness in style to that of the Le Nain brothers. The identification of Willemsens with the Master of the Béguins has not been unanimously accepted in the art historical community.",2021-12-17 09:50:05+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2166,,,531,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Richly dressed in robes befitting a princess, and kneeling on a cushion, she gazes out at the viewer surrounded by the attributes of her martyrdom: the breaking-wheel, the sword with which she was beheaded and the martyr’s palm. The canvas has been dated to shortly before the major cycle that Caravaggio produced for the Contarelli chapel in San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome at a time when his style was moving towards a use of more compact forms constructed from a powerful chiaroscuro that emphasised the expressivity of his compositions. It has been noted that the light source falls in this work from the right, which is unusual in Caravaggio’s oeuvre.

As for the man wearing a helmet on the left side of the painting, he is Polynices—one of Oedipus’ sons. In the chronology of Oedipus myths, this painting is set near the end of the long and tragic saga. Oedipus’ son, Polynices, has come in an attempt to convince his father to join his faction in the civil war. Polynices was on the losing side of the conflict, forced to flee from Thebes and relocate to Argos, and it was that Argive city that he wanted to bring his father, because of a prophecy claiming that whichever city hosted Oedipus’ tomb would be granted victory.

Rembrandt centers the narrative around the two cousins, bathed in a supernatural glow. From the elderly Zacharias, husband of Elizabeth, easing himself down the stairs with the help of a young boy, to Joseph climbing up the hill leading his donkey, the figures are linked by a series of gestures that stress the intimacy and emotions that bind the characters. Animals play a meaningful part in this painting. The dog, while providing a touch of informality, symbolizes faithfulness. The peacock watching over her chicks, a symbol of pride and vanity, is also a symbol for Christ, because it represents the incorruptibility of his flesh. This painting may relate directly to Rembrandt’s life. The face of Elizabeth is reminiscent of the artist’s mother, who died in 1640 just as his wife was about to give birth.",2021-12-13 15:28:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2121,,,572,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Semele wanted to see Zeus in his true character, and when he appeared to her in a flash of lightning, she was consumed by the flame after prematurely giving birth to a son. Zeus sewed the infant up in his thigh and after some time Bacchus was born a second time. Then Zeus commanded Mercury, the envoy of the gods, to take the baby to the nymphs for refuge, so that they might nurture and bring him up. La Hyre's work was noticeably influenced by French Classicism, as is evidenced in the clarity and balance of the composition, the distinct organization of space and the harmony of volumes. In addition, the soft modeling of the figures, warm golden illumination and velvety shades indicate the influence of Venetian painting. La Hyre's style is notable for its easy and unconstrained brushstrokes and a light, joyful palette.",2021-12-13 08:05:05+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2118,,,584,0,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among them is that of recovering a casket from Persephone, divinity of Hades. Carelessly, the box is opened and an imperishable sleep envelops the girl. Luckily, Cupid intervenes and puts the powerful spell back in its container, making Psyche awaken. The moment in which the young god of love makes this gesture is represented by the neoclassical painter Pierre Joseph Célestin Frangois (1759-1851).

There is no clue to the possibility of a confraternity, although the curious emblems on the carpet on the table could be symbols of some secret society. The eerie quality of the picture is emphasized by the fall of the shadows on the faces and by the way in which the figures stare into space, and the seated figure on the right has all the appearance of being under the influence of some drug.

His earlier search for ideal beauty gave way to an examination of the relationship between naturalism and fantasy that would preoccupy him for the rest of his career. He was undergoing a nervous breakdown and entering prolonged physical illness, and admitted that the series was created to reflect his own self-doubt, anxiety and fear that he was going mad. It has been described as a somber vision of human bodies without human reason, as one of Goya's deeply disturbing visions of sadism and suffering, and a work that marks his progression from a commissioned portraitist to an artist that pursued only his bleak and pitiless view of humanity. It's speculated that Goya's symptoms indicated prolonged viral encephalitis, and the mixture of tinnitus, imbalance and progressive deafness may be symptoms of Ménière's disease.

Goya's yard is overwhelmingly stark, showing shackled inmates enclosed by high walls and a heavy stone arch. Inmates fight and grin idiotically or huddle in despair, all bathed in an oppressive grey and green light, guarded by a single man.

msg_iteration.14835.user.ThirstForBeauty.post.2021,1561395949,ThirstForBeauty,2021,,"Bacchus and Ariadne, by Titian The subject matter was derived from the Roman poets Catullus and Ovid. Ariadne has been left on the island of Naxos, deserted by her lover Theseus, whose ship sails away to the far left. She is discovered on the shore by the god Bacchus, leading a procession of revelers in a chariot drawn by two cheetahs. Bacchus is depicted in mid-air as he leaps out of the chariot to protect Ariadne from these beasts. In the sky above the figure of Ariadne is the star constellation Corona Borealis. In his Metamorphoses, Ovid has Bacchus throw the crown of Ariadne into the sky where it becomes the constellation. The follower of Bacchus who struggles with a snake is sometimes falsely associated with the antique sculpture of Laocoön and His Sons who had been killed by snakes. This statue had recently been discovered in Rome. But the satyr in Titian's painting is not in a mortal combat with the snakes, he is merely girding himself with them as is described in the original text by Catullus.",2021-12-09 21:58:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2021,,,485,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It will be proposed here that this work was painted in or shortly after 1833, that it was indeed prompted by the agitation for political reform in the early 1830s, but that its symbolism is more concrete; specifically, that it refers directly to Percy Bysshe Shelley’s newly published ‘The Masque of Anarchy’ (1832) and that the presentation of the skeletal body is informed by contemporary debates concerning human remains. If this argument is accepted, the painting should be re-catalogued as The Fall of Anarchy and dated c.1833–4.",2021-12-09 16:12:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/2020,,,484,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.857094790440553e+18,,Joseph_Mallord_William_Turner_Death_on_a_pale_horse_Google_Art_Project.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cadaver’s outstretched arms show that it retains the supernatural animation of the phantasmagorical skeleton seen in traditional depictions of the Dance of Death, or of the figure of Death, one of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse. However, iconographical difficulties undermine this reading.

It has been proposed that it is a response to the death of Turner’s father in 1829 or to the cholera outbreak of 1832 but these suggestions are at best circumstantial. Without further contextual or narrative underpinnings that might explain it, the painting has the iconic concentration and visual punch of a memento mori. The archetypal figure of Death looms out of a dark background, its open arms spread wide as though to embrace the spectator. The skeleton’s strangely undefined mount, a mere cipher of a horse, adds to the picture’s otherworldly and nightmarish effect. The overall impression is of an apparition, a phantasm, whose oneiric quality propels it out of everyday experience into another realm.

msg_iteration.14890.user.ThirstForBeauty.post.1966,1561395949,ThirstForBeauty,1966,,"The tension between richness and religious contemplation operates at every level. It is thought that the painting — Caravaggio’s first use of the half-length format, which allows for a greater immediacy and sense of physical presence (we can imagine ourselves seated across the table) — was commissioned by a noblewoman and heiress to a vast family fortune, Olimpia Aldobrandini, being an object of conspicuous consumption, displayed to show off Aldobrandini’s taste and wealth among the elite of Rome. The inclusion of the mirror asks viewers to enter into a dynamic conversation about their own delight in the rich textures of the picture; alongside a powder puff and comb, it points us to Mary’s vanity, and her concern with the things of this world. Rather than showing Mary to herself, however, the mirror captures a diamond of light — a visual representation of the divine grace that inspires Mary to look beyond her earthly passions. The flower that Mary clutches to her chest is an orange blossom: symbol of purity.",2021-12-06 18:51:04+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1966,,,529,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.854842990626868e+18,,Michelangelo_Merisi_da_Caravaggio_Martha_and_Mary_Magdalene_73_268.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For Roman viewers, the scene would have gained a particular frisson from their knowledge that the sitter who portrayed Mary was a well-known courtesan, Fillide Melandroni — so that the dynamic of the painting is frustrated by the non-conversion of the real-life counterpart to this ambiguously pious figure. Indeed, for many viewers, the luxury and sensuousness of the painting must have been at least as much, if not perhaps more, of the attraction than its overtly religious content: it offers a genre scene of two Roman women arguing, with the curves of Mary’s face and body echoed in the bulges of the convex mirror on which she rests her left hand (unlike flat steel mirrors, convex mirrors, made from thick, green-tinted ‘forest glass’ blown into globes and lined with lead, did not need to be polished frequently).",2021-12-06 18:47:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1965,,,496,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The boys were recruited into the armies, chosen between twelve and sixteen years of age, among the poorest and orphans. For the painters, their figure became synecdoche - from time to time - or of the extreme and valiant sacrifice, especially in the neoclassical age, or - in the romantic one - of the horror and uselessness of war.

At the time of construction, the building was criticized as too old-fashioned and as a blend of different architectural styles.

This work was produced during the middle of Caravaggio's career, a time that is not fully understood. During this time, however, Caravaggio preferred a magical sense of atmosphere, suspense, and introspection. Caravaggio conveys a dark melancholy. Narcissus' eyes are deeply shadowed, his full lips voluptuous, and his yearning gaze is fixed on black water. Caravaggio's Narcissus is an exemplary showcase of his tenebrism, the strong contrast between very dark and very bright spaces in a painting. Caravaggio uses this to entirely obscure the background. In this painting, there is nothing but Narcissus and his reflection, highlighting the obsessive focus of the youth.

She played an essential role in setting the Romanian revolutionaries free following their inprisonment abord an Ottoman ship on the Danube. Her dedication and energy were an inspiration and turned her into a symbol of the revolutionary uprising in Wallachia. Little wonder that the Budapest-born Rosenthal made her into his muse. The painting shows her dressed in the Romanian folk costume she disguised herself in while following the ship on which the Romanians were held hostage. The pathos of her posture is inspired by various romantic compositions Rosenthal was familiar with.",2021-12-02 03:07:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1886,,,446,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.85043829550639e+18,,CDRosenthal.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.14976.user.ThirstForBeauty.post.1879,1561395949,ThirstForBeauty,1879,,"Scholars have proposed several identifications of the figures, and analyses and interpretations which largely flow from these. The concept of Geminae Veneres or ""Twin Venuses"", a dual nature in Venus, was well developed in both classical thought and Renaissance Neoplatonism. In 1969 the scholar Erwin Panofsky suggested the two figures were representations of the 'Twin Venuses' with the clothed figure representing the 'earthly' Venus - (Venere Vulgare), while the other was 'celestial' (Venere Celeste). This remains the most accepted and convincing interpretation to this day. Others see the clothed figure as representing the bride (idealized, and not a portrait, which would have been rather indecorous in Venice), and only the nude figure representing Venus. Although the first record of a version of what is now the usual title is only in an inventory of 1693, it remains possible that the two female figures are indeed intended to be personifications of the Neoplatonic concepts of sacred and profane love.",2021-12-01 21:27:19+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1879,,,381,0,0,1,PeerChannel,1561395949.0,ThirstForBeauty,2021-10-14 21:56:01,2021-10-14,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/699,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The painting is presumed to have been commissioned by Niccolò Aurelio, a secretary to the Venetian Council of Ten, whose coat of arms appears on the sarcophagus or fountain, to celebrate his marriage to a young widow, Laura Bagarotto. It perhaps depicts a figure representing the bride dressed in white, sitting beside Cupid and accompanied by the goddess Venus. The title of the painting is first recorded in 1693, when it was listed in an inventory as Amor Divino e Amor Profano (Divine love and Profane love), and may not represent the original concept at all. Although much ink has been spilt by art historians attempting to decipher the iconography of the painting, and some measure of consensus has been achieved, basic aspects of the intended meaning of the painting, including the identity of central figures, remain disputed.",2021-12-01 21:27:19+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1878,,,375,0,0,1,PeerChannel,1561395949.0,ThirstForBeauty,2021-10-14 21:55:05,2021-10-14,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/698,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through a broad list of duties and roles, Stieglitz grew into an important modernist figure. Although he is mainly regarded to be a vital force in the development of modern photography in America, Alfred Stieglitz's significance can just as much be attributed to his work as an art dealer, exhibition organizer, publisher and editor. Hell-bent on proving his medium of choice deserves to be considered a fine art form, Alfred's own work showed great technical mastery of tone and texture, underlined by a strong ability of atmospheric explorations. He was feverishly devoted to his creative mission and produced thousands of pictures in his lifetime, covering numerous themes that captured different periods of rapid transition in American society.",2021-12-01 05:27:03+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1805,,,384,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, he depicted Louise-Antoinette Feuardent, the wife of his lifelong friend Félix-Bienaimé Feuardent, a clerk in the library at Cherbourg. In this portrait painted shortly after her marriage, Louise-Antoinette prominently displays her wedding band on her left hand. In a style reminiscent of seventeenth-century Dutch painters, Millet painted the modestly dressed sitter against a plain background using a limited palette. Louise-Antoinette looks out of the picture, her brown eyes calmly assessing the viewer. Through a tightly controlled composition and a careful balance of monochromatic tones, Millet captured Louise-Antoinette's self-containment, reserve, and poised composure.",2021-11-28 09:25:06+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1657,,,1140,0,8,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The composition further adds to the sense of harmony. The mondine figures occupy the centre of the composition and, although they are depicted at varying heights, their shared stance unites them; their individuality is only suggested through slight variations in the colour of their clothes. Morbelli's skilful depiction of their reflections in the water has the effect of melting the figures into the landscape. The high horizon and row of tall trees (also seen in In risai) contributes to a greater sense of depth in the scene, and Morbelli encourages the eye to focus on the figures in the foreground.

Typically there is a helpless maiden being tied up and tormented by an evil villain or monster, when along comes a hero to save her in the nick of time; think Perseus and Andromeda, or St George slaying the dragon. This theme was a popular one with the Pre-Raphaelites during the Victorian era, who felt that a return to the naturalistic paintings and romantic themes of medieval art was necessary. Depictions from stories of Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table were particularly popular, and it is assumed that this painting is of Sir Galahad who saved many a maiden while on his quest for the Holy Grail.

The couple who commissioned the panel look up at the child, meeting his eyes as he rewards their piety with a blessing. As the symbol of Christ's resurrection, the fig branch growing behind the curtain also reassures the donors of their own redemption. In the late 1400s, well-to-do families often commissioned such pictures for hanging in the home or the private chapel of a church. These panels served both as portraits and as testimonies to the donors' religious devotion. Lorenzo Lotto emphasized the contrast between the earthly and the spiritual realms by using a highly naturalistic style for the couple and a more ideal, poetic rendering for the Virgin and child. With a flair for color betraying his Venetian origins, Lotto contrasted Mary's luminous blues and reds with the donors' more somber clothing.",2021-11-27 18:24:33+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1627,,,509,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Van Dyck greatly idealized her in the portrait—and this artistic flattery must have pleased her. Van Dyck has portrayed the queen standing just beyond the portico of an imposing architectural structure. The fluted column emphasizes her already exaggerated height, and the crown and cloth of gold emphasize her royalty. The orange tree behind Henrietta Maria, who was named after both her father, Henri IV of France, and her mother, Maria de' Medici, pays visual homage to her powerful Florentine ancestors. The Medici crest contains five gold balls, thought to represent oranges from the family's renowned citrus tree collection. A symbol of purity, chastity, and generosity, the orange tree was also associated with the Virgin Mary, Henrietta Maria's patron saint.",2021-11-27 16:34:47+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1599,,,443,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,image/jpeg,5.843974550114537e+18,,queen_henrietta_maria_with_sir_jeffrey_hudson_1952.5.39.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Van Dyck portrayed her dressed for the hunt in a brilliant blue satin riding costume with a delicate lace collar instead of the stiff and formal Elizabethan ruff still widely in use. Whereas the queen's graceful pose and demure expression are at once regal and endearing, her stylish wide-brim feathered black hat and shimmering dress create a sense of vibrancy and vitality. The queen's love of entertainment is symbolized by the presence of 14-year-old Sir Jeffrey Hudson and Pug the monkey, both royal favorites.

Cabanel has depicted the young woman, an Oriental courtesan, through the eyes of the poet as she lies back languorously and looks out at us seductively with half closed eyes. The beauty of this woman emanates from her eyes which was described as doe-like. Her silken robe is open to the waist exposing the curve of her breasts.

She is painted bust length, life size and in profile, her fair skin and red hair set against a dark background. It has been described by art historians as ""among the most evocative"" works of its time, with a heightened sense of refinement. Artist and writer R. H. Ives Gammell wrote of the painting: ""The transitions of tone and the minor shifts are stated with great subtlety without losing the larger color relations. At the same time the edges and accents throughout the canvas are given exactly the relative degree of definition perceptible to eyes focused so as to take in the entire area depicted. In the painting itself the young woman appears to exist in space, surrounded by atmosphere and light and shadow. Yet the draftsmanship is so sure that we never lose our sense of the form in all its inherent loveliness. The combination of qualities has only rarely been attained in the painting of a head.""",2021-11-26 21:59:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1581,,,492,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The legend of the Greek lyric poet and musician Arion comes to us from Herodotus. While returning to Corinth after a trip to Sicily, Arion is robbed of his wealth and thrown into the sea by sailors on his ship. Thanks to the intervention of Apollo, a dolphin rescues him and carries him to the shore on its back. The god transforms Arion’s lyre and the dolphin into a constellation in memory of the adventure. Ancient mythology enabled Gustave Moreau to express “the sublime logic of the imagination” which guided his work. However, the poet distanced himself from what he called “that hackneyed old classical Greek style” and invented a visual universe drawing the daring intensity of his colours and a taste for the arabesque from the most exotic sources ranging from India to Japan.",2021-11-26 17:44:09+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1547,,,413,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Waiting for the Stage, three men assemble in a tavern, commonly used as a waiting room for stagecoaches. Two of the men are seated at the table, engaged in what appears to be a game of cards; the gentleman with a carpetbag at his side is presumably a traveler. The third figure stands beside the table clutching a newspaper called The Spy. He wears the glasses of a blind man, but his cleverly titled journal betrays his ruse. From his elevated position, he can see both men's cards, and is likely conspiring with the traveler, who may be a conman. Light bounces off the wedding ring of the third individual, reminding the viewer of the existence of family members whose well-being could be threatened by this deceit.

Whatever the case, all of the artworks drew inspiration from the Battle of Zama, which was fought between Rome and Carthage in the year 202 BCE.

Meanwhile, Hannibal Barca—Carthage’s brilliant general—was still menacing the Italian countryside, as he had been doing since 218 BCE.

The beholder of his gaze is now a guilty counterpart and Bartholomew a witness. Not only was the recording of torture and execution commonplace in Ribera’s time, but the art of the Catholic Counter Reformation called for dramatic images such as these to inspire piety. Theatrical contrasts of light and dark nod to Ribera’s Italian hero Caravaggio – the master of chiaroscuro – and rouse intense emotions.

She stands upright with an expression of emptiness on her lean face and hands clenched at her side. Around her, the courtiers gather with varied expressions. Philip I of Castile died suddenly of typhoid fever, and it was said she carried his casket around with her everywhere, believing one day he would wake from slumber. This depicts a common ritual for her, and the courtiers faces all have looks of boredom and fatigue. The painting is an example of the Spanish historical painting genre. Joanna I (1479-1555), historically known as Joanna the Mad, was Queen of Castile and Queen of Aragon. Modern Spain evolved from the union of these two kingdoms. Despite being a ruling Queen, Joanna had little effect on national policy during her reign as she was declared insane and imprisoned in the Royal Convent of Santa Clara in Tordesillas.",2021-11-23 20:53:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1460,,,533,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chiron stands behind him, kneeling on his front paws to lower himself to the height of his pupil, and is giving him advice: with his left hand he directs the arrow while with his right hand he directs Achilles' arm. The scene takes place on Mount Pelion in front of the Centaur Cave; the Aegean Sea and the Gulf of Thessaloniki can be seen in the distance. Beautifully composed, the two figures are depicted in perfect juxtaposition: young versus old, man versus centaur, light versus dark. Yet, the result is a lyrical harmony enhanced by both the narrative and aesthetic presence of the piece.

The composition depicts a famous episode in the life of the legend Achilles - his education by the centaur Chiron. With his emphasize on symmetry, perspective, and narrative, Chrétien beautifully captures notions of both physical and moral ideals on canvas. The legend of Achilles is one of the richest and oldest of Greek mythology. It was made famous by Homer in The Iliad, which helped to popularize the adventures of the young hero of the Trojan War. Son of Peleus, king of Phthia in Thessaly, and the sea nymph Thetis, Achilles is most remembered for his one weakness - his heel - which would eventually lead to his downfall. Chrétien's composition, however, captures the warrior as a youth with the centaur Chiron, the legendary tutor of gods and heroes who instructed him in the arts of medicine, music, riding and hunting.",2021-11-22 21:06:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1443,,,1178,0,10,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the Sampo was stolen, Ilmarinen's homeland fell upon hard times. He sent an expedition to retrieve it, but in the ensuing battle it was smashed and lost at sea.

Painted for the Irish Shakespeare Gallery in Dublin in 1793, it is still in its original frame. Macbeth, disturbed, visits the three witches once more and asks them to reveal the truth of their prophecies to him. To answer his questions, they summon horrible apparitions, each of which offers predictions and further prophecies to put Macbeth's fears at rest. First, they conjure an armoured head, which tells him to beware of Macduff, Thane of Fife. After the witches perform a mad dance and leave, Macbeth learns that Macduff has fled to England, and he orders Macduff's castle be seized, and, most cruelly, sends murderers to slaughter Macduff, as well as Macduff's wife and children. The bearded Weird Sisters, the troubling images in the cauldron, and Macbeth's rapt, horrified gaze comprise a riveting version of Act 4, Scene 1.",2021-11-20 21:56:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1408,,,575,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much like the Mannerists centuries earlier, Ingres distorted the female form in order to make her body more sinuous and elegant. Her back seems to have two or three more vertebrae than are necessary, and it is anatomically unlikely that her lower left leg could meet with the knee in the middle of the painting, or that her left thigh attached to this knee could reach her hip. One interpretation of this painting suggests that since the duty of some concubines was merely to satisfy the carnal pleasures of the sultan, this elongation of her pelvic area may have been a symbolic distortion by Ingres. While this may represent sensuous feminine beauty, her gaze, on the other hand, has been said to ""reflect a complex psychological make-up"" or ""betray no feeling"". In addition, the distance between her gaze and her pelvic region may be a physical representation of the depth of thought and complex emotions of a woman's thoughts and feelings.",2021-11-19 21:15:09+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1388,,,504,0,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She seemingly peeks over her shoulder, as if to look at someone who has just entered her room, a space that is luxuriously appointed with fine damask and satin fabrics.

This eclectic mix of styles, combining classical form with Romantic themes, prompted harsh criticism when it was first shown in 1814. Critics viewed Ingres as a rebel against the contemporary style of form and content. When the painting was first shown in the Salon of 1819, one critic remarked that the work had ""neither bones nor muscle, neither blood, nor life, nor relief, indeed nothing that constitutes imitation"", having disregarded anatomical realism. Ingres instead favored long lines to convey curvature and sensuality, as well as abundant, even light to tone down the volume.",2021-11-19 20:56:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1383,,,586,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She follows her statement by plunging the dagger into her chest and promptly dying. Collatinus, seeing his wife dead, became distraught. He held her, kissed her, called her name and spoke to her. He passed the dagger around and each mourner swore the same oath by it. The primary sources of both Dio and Livy agree on this point: Livy's version is: ""By this blood—most pure before the outrage wrought by the king's son—I swear, and you, O gods, I call to witness that I will drive hence Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, together with his cursed wife and his whole blood, with fire and sword and every means in my power, and I will not suffer them or anyone else to reign in Rome.""",2021-11-18 21:30:53+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1370,,,580,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to tradition, she was the beautiful and virtuous wife of the nobleman Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus. Her tragedy began when she was raped by Sextus Tarquinius, son of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the tyrannical Etruscan king of Rome. After exacting an oath of vengeance against the Tarquins from her father and her husband, she stabbed herself to death. Lucius Junius Brutus then led the enraged populace in a rebellion that drove the Tarquins from Rome. The event (traditionally dated 509 BCE) marks the foundation of the Roman Republic. The story is first found in the work of the earliest Roman historian, Fabius Pictor (late 3rd century BCE). Its classic form is Livy’s version (late 1st century BCE).

The viewpoint is below the sitter, who looks down at the viewer with a sombre expression. The right side of his unshaven face is heavily shadowed, emphasising his long narrow nose. His left hand holds his gown closed, with the collar of a white shirt appearing at the neck, and the right hand holds a plaque which bears the Latin inscription AVT TACE / AVT LOQVERE MELIORA / SILENTIO, which may be translated ""Be quiet, unless your speech be better than silence"" or ""Either keep quiet, or say something better than silence"".

Her main attribute is the military helmet worn on her head; she often holds a sword, spear, or shield, and brandishes a torch or whip as she rides into battle in a four-horse chariot. She had many temples throughout the Roman Empire. She is known for her temple outside of Rome being the official decision making centre in regards to war and for her bloodlust and madness in battle. The worship of Bellona and beliefs about her were often gory or frightening. It was believed that when she went to war, Discordia, Strife, and the Furies would accompany her and terrify her enemies. The belief in her bloodlust and madness in battle is widely accepted and is one of the more prevalent beliefs. In the military cult of Bellona, she was associated with Virtus, the personification of valour. She then travelled outside Rome with the imperial legions and her temples have been recorded in France, Germany, Britain, and North Africa.",2021-11-17 10:12:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1345,,,609,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, these unnamed condemned souls, frozen into the ice, are completely unable to move or speak and are contorted into all sorts of fantastical shapes as part of their punishment.

Pre-Reformation images could bestow merit upon the beholder and frequently became the objects of veneration themselves. The varied origins and functions of art before the Reformation offered a considerable amount of interpretive freedom to the beholder, a freedom that Lutheran views on images vehemently endeavored to curtail. Thus the didactic format of the painting seeks to define and limit the viewer's response, making it ripe for art-historical criticism less enamored of such moral or instructive values. In one summary, Cranach's work is described as a ""shallow fantasy"" that fails to raise the ""religious thought world of the Reformers ... to an artistic height""; it is ""Protestant allegory overburdened with thoughts"" and ""overweighted with dry, didactic propagandistic content""",2021-11-15 09:05:07+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1320,,,585,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cranach probably drew on input from his lifelong friend Martin Luther when designing these panels, which illustrate the Protestant concept of Law and Gospel. For Luther and Cranach, artworks such as Law and Gospel were intended to instill understanding of scripture and Lutheran thought, and the images were deemed acceptable so long as they were subordinate to the written word.

These marbles from the fourteenth and fifteenth century are the collective and anonymous work of at least three or four masters with assistance of their workshops, It is assumed that Maitani must have worked on the reliefs on the first pier from the left, as work on the reliefs began before 1310.

Situated in a position dominating the town of Orvieto which sits perched on a volcanic plug, the cathedral's façade is a classic piece of religious construction, containing elements of design from the 14th to the 20th century, with a large rose window, golden mosaics and three huge bronze doors. The Gothic façade of the Orvieto Cathedral is one of the great masterpieces of the Late Middle Ages. The three-gable design is attributed to Maitani, who had clearly undergone some influence by the design scheme for the façade in Tuscan Gothic style of the Siena Cathedral by Giovanni Pisano (1287–1297) and the plan for façade of the Florence Cathedral by Arnolfo di Cambio (1294–1302).",2021-11-14 08:10:05+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1302,,,698,0,11,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pontius Pilate displays Christ to the crowd with the words, ""Ecce homo!"" (Latin ""Behold the man""). Caravaggio's version of the scene combined Pilate's display with the earlier moment of Christ, already crowned with thorns, mockingly robed like a king by his tormentors. Stylistically, the painting displays characteristics of Caravaggio's mature Roman-period style. The forms are visible close-up and modelled by dramatic light, the absence of depth or background, and the psychological realism of, the torturer, who seems to mix sadism with pity. Pilate, in keeping with tradition, is shown as a rather neutral and perhaps almost sympathetic figure.

Ixion was an ancient king of the Lapiths who offended Zeus twice, and for his crimes, Ixion was expelled from Olympus and Zeus ordered Hermes to bind him to a wheel (sometimes a wheel of fire) that would spin eternally. Ribera's painting shows the beginning of Ixion's torment; the wheel is barely visible in the background just above Ixion's torso and we can see the chain around Ixion's legs. There is a devilish imp binding Ixion, perhaps meant to represent Hermes but is more likely a generic demon. This painting is remarkable for its masterful use of chiaroscuro and for the depiction of Ixion's body. The contorting muscles and twisting shape are rendered with incredible detail and realism. Even barely showing Ixion's face, Ribera successfully communicated his suffering using his body. Overall the painting is stunning in its intensity.",2021-11-10 21:46:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1256,,,1304,0,14,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The title of the work room is visible above the door as are the tools of her appointment spilling out of a bag to her left.

He titled it Nothing and erected it over the course of five days with a team of workers who moved blocks of air like mimes building the Great Pyramid of Giza. Tens of people were on hand to see the opus unveiled that June. Miller even made a short film about the work, a mockumentary that features fake artists and curators as talking heads. He compares his respective take on nothingness to John Cage’s “4′33″ and Seinfeld. “All I can say personally is that Nothing is very important to me,” Miller said, and that he should be credited with Nothing (specifically the idea of Nothing fashioned into sculpture form), and Gainesville, Florida—not Italy—is where Nothing happened first.” (Source)",2021-11-09 06:47:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1240,,,601,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mars and Venus, relegated here to wall decoration, cue the narrative to unfold, while the eager dog hints none too subtly at the passions concealed behind delicate gestures. In the 1720s, the meticulous rhyming of curves among picture frame, chair-rail, and sofa was extremely in vogue, but in de Troy’s composition it also underscores the theme of physical union.",2021-11-07 17:07:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1216,,,607,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dove of the Holy Spirit appears above Mary's head and suffuses her with a subtle radiance as God the Father looks on from the clouds above. Maella uses the subtle tonal modulations of grisaille to explore how the robust forms and grounded materiality of the Virgin and the surrounding furniture give way to the light-filled clouds and diffused shapes above; through experimenting with light, Maella seeks to bring the worldly and heavenly realms together in support of Catholic devotional practice.

Little wonder she would later become the Patron Saint of Music. Persecution of the Christians began anew under a mysterious prefect named Tercius Almachius. They were given the choice to worship the Roman gods or die. They chose to be martyred for their faith. Cecilia saw them die—crying out to them to stand strong. She was given the same choice: bow to the Roman gods or die. She chose death. Rather than behead her, Almachius sentenced her to be boiled alive in her bath chamber. She survived. A soldier was then sent to behead her, but his three blows with an axe failed.

The contemplative mood of the subject and the diffused, gentle play of light over the broadly painted surfaces are strongly reminiscent of Titian’s Venetian contemporary Giorgione. The canvas has in the past even been attributed to Giorgione. This work exemplifies the luminous, lyrical painting style of Venetian artists of the sixteenth century. Masterful paint handling creates the illusion of soft fur, gold satin, and the red fabric of the sitter’s fashionable cap. With dark eyes that seem to look into the distance, the young man wears an expression that signals a deep, reflective interiority. One gloved hand lingers on the hilt of his sword. His features are particular but also idealized, and with his pensive countenance, he epitomizes Renaissance ideals of poetic male beauty.

He alludes to passages from Epimenides and from either Aratus or Cleanthes. Paul then explained concepts such as the resurrection of the dead and salvation, in effect a prelude to the future discussions of Christology. One might think that, in the wake of his magnificent address, Paul brought in boatloads of converts, but in fact the payoff was pretty slim: “When they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some scoffed; but others said, ‘We will hear you again about this.’” A handful of people who were willing to give Paul the benefit of the doubt—and yet, they were the seeds of European Christianity, and hence of a Christianity that would spread throughout the world.

Jonathan advised him to run away, though David took shelter by the stone Ezel, where their last meeting took place.

Circe was renowned for her vast knowledge of potions and herbs. Through the use of these and a magic wand or staff, she would transform her enemies, or those who offended her, into animals. One of the best known of her legends is told in the Odyssey, when Ulysses visits her island of Aeaea on the way back from the Trojan War and she changes most of his crew into swine. He later manages to persuade her to return them to human shape. The painting shows the sorceress offering a magical potion to Ulysses, though the Greek hero had an antidote to counteract it. Then Circe and Odysseus would become lovers, and for a year, Ulysses remained on the Island of Circe, where they have sons, Latinus and Telegonus. Modern interpretations see Circe as the archetype of the predatory female, a figure of desire, as well as fear due to her bad qualities.",2021-10-30 13:41:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1070,,,525,0,11,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the skull is evidently intended as a vanitas or memento mori, it is unclear why Holbein gave it such prominence in this painting. A simple explanation is that ""memento mori"" was de Dinteville's motto, while another possibility is that this painting represents three levels: the heavens as portrayed by the astrolabe and other objects on the upper shelf, the living world as evidenced by books and a musical instrument on the lower shelf, and death signified by the skull.",2021-10-30 09:31:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1067,,,471,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The conflicts between secular and religious authorities are here represented by Jean de Dinteville, a landowner, and Georges de Selve, the Bishop of Lavaur. The commonly accepted symbol of discord, a lute with a broken string, is included next to a hymnbook in Martin Luther's translation, suggesting strife between scholars and the clergy.

msg_iteration.15764.user.ThirstForBeauty.post.1062,1561395949,ThirstForBeauty,1062,,"""The Ambassadors"" is a painting of 1533 by Hans Holbein the Younger. Also known as ""Jean de Dinteville and Georges de Selve"". As well as being a double portrait, the painting contains a still life of several meticulously rendered objects, the meaning of which is the cause of much debate. It also incorporates a much-cited example of anamorphosis in painting. Just as Jan van Eyck and the Master of Flémalle used extensive imagery to link their subjects to religious concepts, Holbein used symbolic objects around the figures to suggest mostly secular ideas and interests. Among the clues to the figures' associations are a selection of scientific instruments including two globes (one terrestrial and one celestial), a shepherd's dial, a quadrant, a torquetum, and a polyhedral sundial, as well as various textiles including the floor mosaic, based on a design from Westminster Abbey (the Cosmati pavement, before the High Altar), and the carpet on the upper shelf, an example of Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting.",2021-10-30 09:26:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1062,,,459,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sir Nigel should have been born in olden days because by 1350 or so when the story begins, the era of knights-errant was coming slowly to a close. Nigel's grandmother told him all the grand tales of heroes from her times, so by the age of 22, he was burning to prove himself worthy of the old traditions as well as the still romantic ones of his day.

Written in 1906, it is a fore-runner to Doyle's earlier novel The White Company, and describes the early life of that book's hero Sir Nigel Loring in the service of King Edward III at the start of the Hundred Years' War. The novel is relatively unknown today, though it was very popular up through the Second World War. In fact, Doyle himself regarded this and his other historical novels more highly than the Sherlock Holmes adventures for which he is mainly remembered. Everything about Sir Nigel is incredible, from prose to characterization and setting and visualization and imagery, to timing and rhythm, to the story itself. It's an epic of high adventure, violent chivalry, purely satisfying medieval aestheticism and romance.",2021-10-27 09:48:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/1001,,,625,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Chronicles open with the events leading up to the deposition of Edward II in 1326, and cover the period up to 1400, recounting events in western Europe, mainly in England, France, Scotland, the Low Countries and the Iberian Peninsula, although at times also mentioning other countries and regions. The Chronicles were almost immediately popular among the nobility, and many manuscripts were expensively illuminated. In the first quarter of the 15th century many illustrated copies of Book I, as well as some copies of Books II and III, were produced by the Parisian booktrade. Nearly half of these surviving copies can be linked to a particular libraire, called Pierre de Liffol. Several artistic hands can be detected in these copies, but two anonymous miniature painters seem to stand out as regular collaborators in Liffol's production: the Boethius Master and the Giac Master.",2021-10-26 17:58:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/984,,,436,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An important monument of Byzantine art, an outstanding example of the early Christian basilica in its purity and simplicity of its design and use of space and in the sumptuous nature of its decoration. The upper section of the triumphal arch depicts, inside a medallion, Christ. At the sides, within a sea of clouds, are the winged symbols of the four Evangelists: the Eagle (John), the Winged Man (Matthew), the Lion (Mark), the Calf (Luke). The lower section has, at its two edges, the walls showing precious gems from which twelve lambs (symbols of the Twelve Apostles) exit. The sides of the arch show two palms which, in the Bible's symbolism, represent justice; under them are the archangels Michael and Gabriel, with the bust of St. Matthew and another unidentified saint.",2021-10-25 19:03:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/953,,,443,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1881 the Hungarian artist Gyula Benczur made a painting from which emerges all the beauty and at the same time the overwhelming passion that Narciso felt for himself. The canvas is characterized by a completely bare environment, distinguished only by a stone wall where the figure of the protagonist rests. In the lower part and behind the shoulders of Narcissus, deep darkness and semi-darkness dominate, as attention must be focused on the figure of Narcissus, who occupies a central place in the canvas. The light places the accent on the sculptural anatomy of the young man, whose perfection is enhanced by the flexion of the torso that bends in an arch, demonstrating the tension of the muscles, all reaching towards the water.",2021-10-25 16:40:06+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/952,,,480,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1777 it was brought into the Vatican and restored by Gaspare Sibilla and Giovanni Pierantoni and mounted on four lions carved by Francesco Antonio Franzoni. The coffin is carved with military scenes with Roman soldiers on horseback and barbarian prisoners. On the lid of the sarcophagus figures of cupids and victories hold garlands, while on the very top there are two lions either side of the ridge - one sleeping, the other lying down.

According to Christian tradition, the basilica was consecrated circa 325 to house the relics of the Passion of Christ. The basilica's floor was covered with soil from Jerusalem, thus acquiring the title in Hierusalem; it is not dedicated to the Holy Cross of Jerusalem, but the basilica was considered in a sense to be ""in Jerusalem"" (much in the way that an embassy today is considered extra-territorial).

Flaubert's principal source was Book I of Polybius's Histories. After the First Punic War, Carthage is unable to fulfill promises made to its army of mercenaries, and finds itself under attack. The fictional title character, a priestess and the daughter of Hamilcar Barca, the foremost Carthaginian general, is the object of the obsessive lust of Matho, a leader of the mercenaries. With the help of the scheming freed slave, Spendius, Matho steals the sacred veil of Carthage, the Zaïmph, prompting Salammbô to enter the mercenaries' camp in an attempt to steal it back. The Zaïmph is an ornate bejewelled veil draped about the statue of the goddess Tanit in the sanctum sanctorum of her temple: the veil is the city's guardian and touching it will bring death to the perpetrator.",2021-10-22 07:03:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/852,,,410,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, however, the established views on Sol Invictus have come under sustained attack, and at present the scholarly community is divided on Sol between traditionalists and a growing group of revisionists. In the traditional view, Sol Invictus was the second of two entirely different sun gods in Rome. The first of these, Sol Indiges, or Sol, was an early Roman deity of minor importance whose cult had petered out by the first century AD. Sol Invictus, on the other hand, was a Syrian sun god, whose cult was first promoted in Rome under Elagabalus, without success.

These all signify the transient effects of misdirected sensual pleasure. Even the act of pulling on a stocking had a clear message; namely that impetuous behaviour such as pulling on a stocking too quickly could result in its being holed, just as yielding to sensuality could lead to ruin. Steen implies that to pass through the arch would be to risk the loss of virtue.

A young woman is shown partially undressed, with an unlaced jacket, putting on a stocking. A lapdog lies on her unmade bed, by which there is a chamber pot, and her shoes are scattered on the floor. The figure is alluring and looks straight out at the viewer with an inviting expression. Seduction is her intent. The viewer, however, is kept out of the room itself, which lies beyond an imposing arched doorway imbued with classical features. Two columns with Corinthian capitals rest on bases decorated with cartouches, whilst the arch itself is adorned with swags and a weeping cherub. There is a marked and deliberate contrast between the interior and the exterior, to the extent that this is clearly to be read as an allegorical painting.",2021-10-18 16:50:06+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/782,,,1206,0,11,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They came out of the water in the spring to transfer life-giving moisture to the fields and thus helped nurture the crops. In 19th-century versions, a rusalka is an unquiet, dangerous being who is no longer alive, associated with the unclean spirit. Young women, who either committed suicide by drowning due to an unhappy marriage or who were violently drowned against their will (especially after becoming pregnant with unwanted children), must live out their designated time on Earth as rusalki. However, the initial Slavic lore suggests that not all rusalki occurrences were linked with death from water.

Folklorists have proposed a variety of origins for the entity, including that they may originally stem from Slavic paganism, where they may have been seen as benevolent spirits. In modern popular culture, they may resemble mermaids with legs. The term ""rusalka"" derives from ""rusalija"" which entered Slavic languages, via Byzantine Greek ""rousália"" (Medieval Greek: ῥουσάλια), from the Latin ""Rosālia"" as a name for Pentecost and the days adjacent to it. Longstanding, likely pre-Christian, annual traditions resulted in that time of year being associated with spirits which were subsequently named for the holiday (during Rusalka week it was believed the rusalki were most dangerous and swimming in waters was strictly forbidden).",2021-10-16 18:08:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/752,,,400,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.16107.user.ThirstForBeauty.post.699,1561395949,ThirstForBeauty,699,,"Scholars have proposed several identifications of the figures, and analyses and interpretations which largely flow from these. The concept of Geminae Veneres or ""Twin Venuses"", a dual nature in Venus, was well developed in both classical thought and Renaissance Neoplatonism. In 1969 the scholar Erwin Panofsky suggested the two figures were representations of the 'Twin Venuses' with the clothed figure representing the 'earthly' Venus - (Venere Vulgare), while the other was 'celestial' (Venere Celeste). This remains the most accepted and convincing interpretation to this day. Others see the clothed figure as representing the bride (idealized, and not a portrait, which would have been rather indecorous in Venice), and only the nude figure representing Venus. Although the first record of a version of what is now the usual title is only in an inventory of 1693, it remains possible that the two female figures are indeed intended to be personifications of the Neoplatonic concepts of sacred and profane love.",2021-10-14 21:56:01+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/699,,,1099,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msg_iteration.16108.user.ThirstForBeauty.post.698,1561395949,ThirstForBeauty,698,,"This is a oil painting by Titian, probably painted in 1514, early in his career. The painting is presumed to have been commissioned by Niccolò Aurelio, a secretary to the Venetian Council of Ten, whose coat of arms appears on the sarcophagus or fountain, to celebrate his marriage to a young widow, Laura Bagarotto. It perhaps depicts a figure representing the bride dressed in white, sitting beside Cupid and accompanied by the goddess Venus. The title of the painting is first recorded in 1693, when it was listed in an inventory as Amor Divino e Amor Profano (Divine love and Profane love), and may not represent the original concept at all. Although much ink has been spilt by art historians attempting to decipher the iconography of the painting, and some measure of consensus has been achieved, basic aspects of the intended meaning of the painting, including the identity of central figures, remain disputed.",2021-10-14 21:55:05+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/698,,,803,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead of heroic warriors and epic battles, the heroes of the Kalevala are singers and shamans, not soldiers, and when they face off against each other, instead of reaching for their weapons they break into song. Väinämöinen, goes on a quest not unlike those of more familiar epics; but instead of seeking a magical weapon, he is simply seeking ‘words’ – spells and tales that have been lost. The inhabitants of this poem are not fighters: they're farmers, hunters, fishermen, metalsmiths. The world is full of mystery but it revolves around cattle, populations of fish, the threat of wolves and bears outside the village, occasional ritualised celebrations like a birth or a wedding. Despite the supernature, it is refreshingly down-to-earth.

In medieval Europe, like trial by combat, trial by ordeal, such as cruentation, was considered a ""judgement of God"" (Latin: judicium Dei): a procedure based on the premise that God would help the innocent by performing a miracle on his behalf. The practice has much earlier roots, attested to as far back as the Code of Hammurabi and the Code of Ur-Nammu. One example would be how during the First Crusade, the mystic Peter Bartholomew allegedly went through the ordeal by fire in 1099 by his own choice to disprove a charge that his claimed discovery of the Holy Lance was fraudulent.

The collection of sculptures hosted in the cemetery can be considered as a most significant and genuine example of the quality attained in marble carving in Greece between 1850 and 1920. Memorial art flourished during the 19th century and marked the rebirth of the new Greek state. All kinds of monuments and ornamental patterns appeared which conveyed the influence of ancient times (stelae, columns, reliefs, sarcophagi, small neoclassical temples).

Against the background of a clear blue sky the lady's profile stands out, marked by a thin black line. The mass of the hair, supported by a veil, is surrounded by a string of small pearls. The extraordinary richness of the dress, the hairstyle and the jewels suggests that it is an important figure of the Florentine aristocracy. The work, datable to about 1470-1475, belongs to an important series of female portraits painted in the second half of the fifteenth century by Piero del Pollaiolo. The great attention to the effects of light, which is reflected on the lady's golden hair, on pearls and precious stones and on the complexion of the face, testifies to the influence of the innovations introduced in Italy by contemporary Flemish painters. https://www.facebook.com/756344674478203/posts/4299708776808424/?app=fbl",2021-10-13 17:48:10+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/638,,,335,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their number became fixed at three: -Clotho (""spinner"") -Lachesis (""allotter"") -Atropos (""the unturnable"", a metaphor for death). The role of the Moirai was to ensure that every being, mortal and divine, lived out their destiny as it was assigned to them by the laws of the universe. For mortals, this destiny spanned their entire lives, and was represented as a thread spun from a spindle. Generally, they were considered to be above even the gods in their role as enforcers of fate, although in some representations Zeus, the chief of the gods, is able to command them.",2021-10-13 16:42:45+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/634,,,333,0,10,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The work shows an uncomfortable Susanna with the two men lurking above her while she is in the bath. This was a popular scene to paint during the time of the Baroque period.

She was present at the Crucifixion and later went to anoint Christ's dead body (in accordance with Jewish burial ritual), only to discover that he was resurrected. As in this painting, the Magdalene is often depicted as a great beauty with long golden hair. She is shown here transferring the ointment from a maiolica pharmacy jar to a smaller vessel.

msg_iteration.16220.user.ThirstForBeauty.post.575,1561395949,ThirstForBeauty,575,,"Italian painter Giovanni Bellini [1430-1516] was the founder of the Venetian school of painting and raised Venice to a center of Renaissance art that rivaled Florence and Rome. He brought to painting a new degree of realism, a new wealth of subject matter, and a new sensuousness in form and color. Perhaps more than any other, Giovanni Bellini [Giambellino] was an artist who passed through different periods and cultural revolutions. He, before Leonardo, was the great inventor of the representation of sentiment and nature, painting works of extraordinary poetry, landscapes that brought together everything that had been seen until then in Italy and Europe, with the human figure totally immersed in the surrounding space. These moving, deeply felt scenes are also intimately Venetian – in the softness of the light, in the sober realism of the men and women, in the taste for details of vegetation described in a single botanic identity.",2021-10-12 14:57:03+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/575,,,404,0,5,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bertuccio’s Bride (1895) is one of Hughes’ earlier narrative paintings, which was derived from a series of illustrations which he painted for WG Waters’ translation of a sixteenth century collection of Italian short stories by the obscure Straparola, known as The Nights of Straparola. These stories are told in a similar manner to those of Bocaccio’s Decameron, although the Nights of Straparola has never achieved the same fame. Shown here is Bertuccio making the knight the offer to divide the wedding gifts. The princess, in full bridal gown, is seen at the far left, looking anxious.

She retreated to a solitary existence in a moated house. She is still in love with Angelo – now Deputy to the Duke of Vienna – and longs to be reunited with him. In the picture the autumn leaves scattered on the ground mark the passage of time. Mariana has been working at some embroidery and pauses to stretch her back. Her longing for Angelo is suggested by her pose and the needle thrust fiercely into her embroidery. The stained-glass windows in front of her show the Annunciation, contrasting the Virgin's fulfilment with Mariana's frustration and longing. Millais copied the scene from the window of the Chapel of Merton College, Oxford. However, the heraldic design appears to have been his own invention.",2021-10-11 23:02:31+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/560,,,1027,0,19,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The exterior is faced with gray and pink stone, and features a total of 112 red granite columns with Corinthian capitals, each hewn and erected as a single block. The dome is decorated with twelve statues of angels by Josef Hermann. With an internal height of 69m, it ranks among the tallest domes in the world. Suspended underneath the peak of the dome is a sculpted white dove representing the Holy Spirit. Internal features such as columns, pilasters, the floor are composed of multicolored granites and marbles gathered from all parts of Russia.",2021-10-10 18:09:29+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/502,,,512,0,18,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the works failed to sell, Gilmore supported Cole’s travels abroad. Immigrating to the United States from England at the age of eighteen, Cole was likely inspired by contemporary British art when he conceived his scene of the Expulsion. He had relied upon British drawing books and prints for the rudiments of his artistic education, and his scene of Adam and Eve dwarfed by promontories of terrifying proportions recalls British painter and printmaker John Martin’s illustrations for John Milton’s Paradise Lost, which was popular on both sides of the Atlantic. Cole’s dramatic use of light streaming through the rocky portal to Paradise is clearly reminiscent of Martin’s history paintings.",2021-10-10 08:41:24+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/482,,,1186,0,28,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The text was extremely popular in the late Middle Ages. It was translated in 1389 from Latin into French, and the translation provided the stimulus for many editions of richly illuminated manuscripts to be produced in 15thcentury France. The example in Brussels is particularly sumptuous. The exceptionally high quality miniatures in the first section of the manuscript were executed by the Rolin Master, the illuminator of the Missal of Jean Rolin, now in Lyons. The miniature on folio 39r shows Old Testament events taking place in the ecclesiastical court of a Dominican monastery. The stories are taken from the Books of Daniel (upper register), the Book of Esther (central register) and the Book of Samuel (lower register).",2021-10-07 20:51:10+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/386,,,686,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hidden room in man’s house where God sits all the year, The secret window whence the world looks small and very dear. He sees as in a mirror on the monstrous twilight sea The crescent of his cruel ships whose name is mystery; They fling great shadows foe-wards, making Cross and Castle dark, They veil the pluméd lions on the galleys of St. Mark; And above the ships are palaces of brown, black-bearded chiefs, And below the ships are prisons, where with multitudinous griefs, Christian captives sick and sunless, all a labouring race repines Like a race in sunken cities, like a nation in the mines. They are lost like slaves that sweat, and in the skies of morning hung The stair-ways of the tallest gods when tyranny was young. They are countless, voiceless, hopeless as those fallen or fleeing on Before the high Kings’ horses in the granite of Babylon. And many a one grows witless in his quiet room in hell Where a yellow face looks inward through the lattice of his cell, And he finds his God forgotten, and he seeks no more a sign— (But Don John of Austria has burst the battle-line!) Don John pounding from the slaughter-painted poop, Purpling all the ocean like a bloody pirate’s sloop, Scarlet running over on the silvers and the golds, Breaking of the hatches up and bursting of the holds, Thronging of the thousands up that labour under sea White for bliss and blind for sun and stunned for liberty.

Queen Genepil (1905-1938) was the last queen of Mongolia and wife of the last Mongol Khan. After the death of her husband, she was arrested and executed in 1938, as part of the systematic Stalinist destruction of Mongolian culture and any reminders of the old regime.A vast number of the population were killed, including almost all the shamans and Buddhist lamas of Mongolia. It is estimated that between 20,000 and 35,000 ""enemies of the revolution"" were executed, which represented 3 to 5 percent of Mongolia’s total population at the time. Genepil's daughter, Tserenkhand, who managed to survive the Great Purge, recalled the sudden disappearance of her mother as a child saying, “They took her away at night. She did not wake us, only left a piece of sugar on our pillows. I still remember the joy of a sudden discovery of that rare delicacy in the morning.”",2021-10-07 07:40:09+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/362,,,849,0,26,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the assassins ordered Gaius’ courtiers to disperse, pretending that he wished to be alone, Claudius went off with the rest and retired to a room called the Hermaeum; but he soon heard about the murder and slipped away in alarm to a nearby balcony, where he hid trembling behind the door curtains. A common soldier who happened to be running past noticed a pair of feet beneath the curtain, pulled their owner out for identification, and recognized him. Claudius dropped on the floor and clasped the soldier’s knees, but found himself acclaimed emperor” (The Twelve Caesars, Divus Claudius, section 10).",2021-10-06 21:40:20+00:00,https://t.me/ThirstForBeauty/344,,,743,0,8,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.16512.user.ThirstForBeauty.post.250,1561395949,ThirstForBeauty,250,,"The Church of Saint-Sulpice-de-Faviéres Built from the 31th century onwards, this Gothic church strikes the visitor with its exceptional dimensions compared to the size of the village (315 inhabitants). It looks like a cathedral because it is a pilgrimage church, it can accommodate up to 4.000 devotees. Tradition has it that Saint Sulpice was honored in Favieres in the 7th century. The saint, on a trip to Paris, reportedly resurrected a child drowned in Juine, in Chamarande. The village quickly became an important pilgrimage center. From the 13th century until the Revolution, writings relate to the miracles obtained here.

When I look at my gallery I am amazed at what I saved throughout the years. I don't have anything uploaded at all, what am i going to do if i lose my phone somehow lol Anyway, i simply feel compelled to share all this with as many people as possible. Sharing aesthetics is ecstatic for me. This screen however tiny, can open a very large world, but i hope all of it will take you to the narrow path. May all this beauty act as more than a mere consolation or refuge, but act as a rejuvenating, reinvigorating jolt. Let everybody know of what wonders lie hidden among the ruins of the modern world, and in this hellscape of internet.

msg_iteration.23.user.blackswanuncensored.post.297,1990778928,blackswanuncensored,297,,"Police, Crime and the System. In todays society the police force is the enemy of the people. In a healthy regime the police are there to uphold the laws of a just society and keep the law abiding masses safe, lock up criminals, and other threats to society. Western society is rotten to the core, this is plain for everyone to see. Crime has skyrocketed to unprecedented proportions, and not just due to the influx of foreign criminals. The lack of culture under liberal capitalism is toxic to the soul. Many of our people have turned to drugs and other vices to fill a gap left by not being able to participate in a coherent culture and safe, actualised nation. Drugs inevitably lead to crime for many people. Liberal capitalism is anti life, and it programs the people accordingly. Our police force enforces the laws of the sick system that creates alienated criminals. When you look at it from this point of view it becomes obvious that the police are in fact largely responsible for the state of society. If all law enforcement refused to enforce the laws of the beast it would not be able to function. Many look down on criminals for their choices in life, rightly so, but it should be remembered that the police are largely responsible for making them this way by participating in and enforcing the system. Many people join the police out of a need to serve the community, but an equal amount join for power. For some losers a badge is like a cock extension. The public is generally speaking not supportive of the police in Australia. Recruit attrition is high, and recruitment itself is stagnant. Nationalist organisations in Australia currently recruit at a faster rate than state and federal policing institutions and security agencies. It is a risk to be a police officer, but in this age it is more of a risk to be a Nationalist. If you truely want to serve the people, you ought to get active in the Nationalist struggle.

msg_iteration.44.user.blackswanuncensored.post.270,1990778928,blackswanuncensored,270,,"Announcement. In late 2018, I removed Stuart Von Moger from our organisation for a period of five years to assess his compatibility with our community and its values. The main reason was due to his machiavellian insubordination and impostering of leadership roles in order to deceive Inter-State members. The main deception was to help organise the branch stacking of political parties against my direct orders and resulting in - ""Bringing the Organisation into Disrepute"". Their are further actions that negatively marked his character which were part of the reason why he was removed for so long which I do not feel the need to repeat publicly. This was now 6 years ago and something of this nature does not normally warrant a public announcement. However, other more serious accusations have come to light in recent weeks. Stuart Von Moger openly admitted to members of our community while drunk that he regularly informs ASIO on matters regarding our movement. I quote ""ASIO rings me every other week for the scoop"". If I heard this of anyone else I would of course be concerned and would pass on an internal memo to all our members and wider community to avoid said individual. However, Stuart Von Moger is no ordinary member of the wider community. He has a unique personality whereby he keeps tabs on almost everyone of any importance, constantly messaging, gossiping and sharing information on people, events and happenings. Always sharing with a person that he knows their personal details, timings, and movements back to them, often in hopes that said person will elaborate on events in order to justify themself, and in the process revealing more information. I believe Stuart Von Moger's primary motivation is his need to feel important, this in combination with his investigative and deceptive mind makes him the perfect machiavellian stooge for ASIO's informant ruse. He is excommunicated from our circles and anyone that continues to associate with him will not be welcome in ours.

One they have leaders with the extremely rare qualities of having both honor and charisma together. They've managed to find several of these people in the same place at the same time. Furthermore they instill this honor and sense of duty in their members and enforce it in their rules. They have standards that go beyond just showing up a few times a month. We've said it on this channel several times, character is more important than ideology. If someone is weaker in ideology but strong in character and honor, he can learn ideology pretty fast. If someone is ideologically strong but of poor character and honor, he's just going to be a burden at some point. Look at all these honorless zilches you find on the internet. They can quote everything GLR or WLP or AH said, but they can't be bothered to show up in real life. Then there's the men who do show up but have no sense of duty and only want to be part of a weekend social club. By having standards, levels of access, and creating a top down honor culture; the Australians have largely weeded out the bad apples and honorless men. @TheWesternChauvinist7",2024-07-04 01:47:18+00:00,https://t.me/blackswanuncensored/250,,,261,0,0,1,PeerChannel,2098483931.0,,2024-07-04 01:44:42,2024-07-04,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.100.user.blackswanuncensored.post.214,1990778928,blackswanuncensored,214,,"Announcement. Late last year, I removed Stefanos Eracleous a.k.a 'Medi' from our organisation for a period of two years to assess his compatibility with our community and its values. The main reason was due to him directly disobeying a command I gave during an activism stand-down period, whereby he engaged in activism that I deemed not in the interest and safety of the organisation. Over the years, several people have been removed from the organisation on similar charges - ""Bringing the Organisation into Disrepute"". Something of this nature does not normally warrant a public announcement. However, I had other more serious accusations at the time that were beginning to unfold. During the time I was imprisoned we had several fundraisers, the former BuyMeACoffee, the latter GiveSendGo, and our Crypto address. I can not account for the money that was raised by numerous individuals who are no longer members. In the last year alone I have had over a dozen people in our wider community specifically ask me about hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars they had sent Stefanos Eracleous to pass on to me. With the exception of two occasions where Stefan passed on a couple hundred dollars to me, I have never seen the large sums of money that many trustworthy people in our community had sent to him. Furthermore, I have had many more people tell myself or one of my State Leaders that Stefanos had called them desperately asking for money, on many occasions he even stated that he was raising on behalf of the org and myself, but never in writing as to not leave a paper trail of his deceitful actions. I have spoken to Stefan about this and asked him to pay back the money that I estimate he's obtained in the thousands fraudulently, and a portion of money that was raised by our org members in the tens of thousands, in which I have many witness testimonies who state the money has not been spent on legal matters, but in fact on dubious personal entertainment. He has paid back a small fraction of the money and continues to deny any wrong doing and instead counter-claims that I am trying to ""extort him"". This individual has stolen from me, he has stolen from many of you, he has fraudulently obtained funds that are critical and limited to the legitimacy and legal defence of our movement here in Australia, and he has whatever the Cypriot version of ""Chutzpah"" is; to accuse my Senior Leaders and I, of dishonorable and illegal conduct. I have received over the years around $400 in small notes from Stefanos, but I estimate that he has accumulated roughly $45,000 from phone calls, grifting and other means. To make matters worse, my estimate is only based on the amount of people that have come forward prior to me making this announcement. I fear it is much worse. I never placed Stefanos in charge of collecting money on the organisation or my behalf. It saddens me deeply how much money could have been raised for my trial or for appeals for my bail, or for the political prisoners in South Australia who suffered greatly at the terror of the State for years for allegedly owning books, while this individual enriched himself. I believe Stefanos has some very expensive habits and has used the organisation and wider community to fund these habits for some time. Despite the damage that this announcement makes to the reputation of our organisation and ideals, it is worth being transparent for the sake of our future reputation, that behaviour of this kind has no place in our community, and under my leadership I will more effectively root it out and destroy it. Lastly, under no circumstance should anyone, ever, give money to Stefan Eracleous, for any purpose.

For every 5000 complainers online, who do nothing but complain about the jews or the decline of our society, there is maybe 1 man of action who is actually involved in the movement in real life, putting in real work. Spreading our worldview and our message is important, and the internet is a valuable tool in doing so, but doing nothing but complaining and winging online is pathetic and unbecoming of a White man. Complaining is an extremely feminine behaviour. Having worked physical jobs all my life, the workplace has always by nature had semblances of masculinity still in tact, and complainers would just be laughed at and told to shut up whilst the men continued the work. A White man of honour identifies and recognises the problem, then begins enacting a solution, without unreasonable or unnecessary complaint, as it is not productive and does not contribute to the task at hand in any way.

The plaques around this cell speak in a way of these by-gone days, that we as a society have moved past such cruel and unusual punishment.

Logically, this means anti-White social-political messaging is deliberately created and funded by certain special-interest groups. Nobody develops ethnic self-loathing naturally or on the basis of their own unique thinking. They get there through constant exposure to propaganda and because they come to understand that it’s profitable for them. Personally, there is no amount of clever propaganda or money that will compel me to hate myself or act ashamed of my own ancestors. I don’t care if they killed people, whatever they did is the basis for me being here now. The idea that various ‘indigenous tribes’ existed throughout the world in relative peace and harmony before ‘White devils’ arrived to massacre them all is propaganda, because it hits the most basic fundamental requirement for all propaganda –it produces a good vs evil dynamic; it oversimplifies history, ensuring mass-acceptance, since the masses are simpletons, the most oversimplified summaries of history are always the most universally accepted ones. But provide evidence to me that my ancestors did massacre foreign tribes and it still wouldn’t make me feel shame.

MANTENERE VIVA LA FIAMMA Dominique Venner 2013 - 2023 Gli interventi del convegno proibito Il 21 maggio 2013, quando Dominique Venner ha compiuto il suo rito sacrificale a Notre-Dame de Paris, una scintilla si è accesa. Il suo messaggio, forgiato nell’esempio, ha trovato dimora nei cuori dei tanti europei che rifiutano la scomparsa del proprio retaggio ed insorgono contro il fatalismo. Dieci anni dopo, il 21 maggio 2023, l’Institut Iliade ha voluto rendere omaggio al “samurai d’Occidente”, guardando al futuro e dimostrando che la fiamma arde ancora, che l’appello è stato ascoltato e che il nome di Dominique Venner risuona come un potente richiamo all’azione. L’evento – però – è stato arbitrariamente vietato dalla Prefettura di Parigi, in applicazione di una direttiva liberticida emanata dal Ministro degli Interni. Poiché crediamo che la libertà vada conquistata e mai chiesta – e poiché difendiamo la Civiltà europea e le libertà che essa ha generato – abbiamo deciso di pubblicare i testi di quella conferenza proibita. Questo libro, dunque, contiene gli interventi mai pronunciati di François Bousquet, Lionel Rondouin, Chiara del Fiacco, Jean-Yves Le Gallou, François Veaunes, Grégoire Gambier e Solenn Marty.

Il avait fréquenté le ""Tout Paris"" et rencontré de merveilleux et grands acteurs. Fin critique et écrivain de talent, ses souvenirs, parfois impertinents, donnaient un livre qui nous faisait entrer dans un univers intéressant et excentrique : le théâtre, ses lieux, ses vedettes, ses pièces, ses petites mains. Une description savoureuse où se mêlaient anecdotes et humour. _____________________________________________________________________ 👉 Abonnez-vous à la newsletter de TVL 👉 Inscription gratuite sur TVL.fr _____________________________________________________________________ 🔵 Site officiel : https://www.tvl.fr 🔵 Notre boutique : https://boutiquetvl.fr/ 🔵 Retrouvez-nous sur Odysee : https://odysee.com/@TVL:e 🔵 TVL sur Dailymotion : https://www.dailymotion.com/TVLIBERTES 🔵 Notre chaîne officielle Telegram : https://t.me/TVLofficiel 🔵 Réseaux sociaux : https://www.facebook.com/tvlibertes/ https://twitter.com/tvlofficiel?lang=fr https://www.tiktok.com/@tvl_officiel https://www.instagram.com/tvlofficiel/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Men may or may not think it is cool that a woman is smart or strong or beautiful or a good worker, but most men will cut a woman a lot of slack in other areas if they believe her to be truly loyal to them. And if she isn’t, eventually none of those other qualities matter. A man wants to believe he can trust a woman when he’s away. And he wants to believe that she’ll be there through thick and thin and be on his side and on his team, no matter what. Loyalty to her father and his family, then to her husband and his family, has been highly valued in women in most cultures, and it should probably be included in a list of either what it means to “be good at being a woman” or perhaps “being a good woman.” To develop a future-oriented culture that incorporates an understanding of human nature and works in harmony with it, we will need positive ideals for women and ways for them to help contribute their talents to the development of a better world.

Quand ils envahissaient une ville, ils la pillaient de fond en comble, et après leur ambition n'était pas de l'habiter, mais de la raser.

msg_iteration.301.user.Zentropa451.post.43465,1187228866,Zentropa451,43465,,"On apprend tôt aux enfants à « aller voir la maîtresse » lorsqu’ils sont victimes de coups ou d’agressions, pas assez à se défendre eux-mêmes ou, au minimum, à faire face à une situation de conflit. Pas intellectuellement, mais physiquement, avec leurs instincts. Le courage n’est pas une construction intellectuelle et ne se forge pas avec des mots mais avec l’expérience directe, physique, instinctive de la vie, des difficultés et de la souffrance physique. La culture des normes et de la résolution pacifique du conflit, voire du conflit comme « échec », est une tendance lourde et particulièrement pernicieuse dans nos sociétés, en particulier pour les instincts virils. Ce travail de formatage des institutions publiques, qui invite les enfants et les citoyens à s’en remettre à l’institution dans la gestion des conflits tout en sachant parfaitement que ces institutions ne remplissent pas ce rôle et ne le pourront jamais, est une catastrophe sur le plan éducatif et ses impacts sur la population autochtone particulièrement lourds. La prépondérance des valeurs maternelles qui doivent savoir progressivement se placer en retrait à partir de quatre ou cinq ans dans l’éducation du jeune garçon et le manque de présence des valeurs de pères viennent renforcer à chaque instant ces tendances. La culture de l’honneur individuel et familial doit précéder la culture de la norme sociale de la collectivité politique. Les instincts de défense ne doivent pas être inhibés par un matraquage moral maternant ou par une culture de la légitimité supposée des corps de l’Etat dans l’exercice de la violence légitime. Et ce pour une raison simple : il n’assure pas correctement cette mission et ne l’assurera jamais. Le respect des règles deviendra plus tard un prétexte à son manque d’esprit de défense, d’initiative, de révolte. Loin de toute culture suprémaciste (« nous sommes les meilleurs ») aux effets accablants lorsqu’on ne domine pas un rapport de forces, apprenez-lui aussi à perdre et donnez-lui l’envie de recommencer et de gagner. Faites comprendre à votre garçon que ce qui est honteux ce n’est pas de perdre une bataille, un moment de conflit, mais de s’y dérober par lâcheté. Que perdre c’est parfois triste mais c’est honorable, en tout cas plus que de se soumettre. Revaloriser et soutenir son enfant, y compris dans ses manifestations d’agressivité (parfois inadéquates), c’est légitimer son agressivité naturelle et l’aider à gérer le conflit par ses propres moyens. Ne pas lui apprendre à chercher le soutien des adultes et de l’institution, qui dans l’immense majorité des cas ne le protégera pas lorsqu’il en aura besoin. Cet aspect de l’éducation des jeunes garçons est fondamental. Quelques exemples pratiques ? Ne relevez pas un enfant en bas âge lorsqu’il tombe mais encouragez-le à se relever seul jusqu’à ce qu’il réussisse et félicitez-le lorsque c’est fait, par des mots ou un geste de tendresse. Ne grondez pas votre enfant s’il manifeste de l’agressivité ou de la violence raisonnable dans une relation avec d’autres enfants, n’intervenez que s’il y a un réel risque et de façon non morale mais disciplinaire. Apprenez, certes, à votre enfant l’existence des normes collectives mais sans jamais oublier de lui rappeler la première de toutes les normes : la survie et la capacité de se faire respecter et de se défendre. Valorisez cela à chaque fois que nécessaire. La capacité d’un garçon à exprimer ses préférences, à exprimer son agressivité, à régler les conflits par lui-même, sans chercher un appui, est une condition indispensable à sa construction virile. L’en priver c’est l’exposer, l’affaiblir, le mettre en danger. Si vous espérez un jour pouvoir compter sur son aide et sa force, c’est donc vous mettre en danger, vous aussi.

msg_iteration.303.user.Zentropa451.post.43463,1187228866,Zentropa451,43463,,"Le changement de mode de vie des trois dernières générations en Europe, sur le plan alimentaire notamment, a profondément bouleversé les métabolismes pour des raisons en partie sanitaires (généralisation des perturbateurs endocriniens à corréler avec la baisse de fécondité et l’augmentation des cancers et malformations génitales masculines). Soyez attentifs à l’alimentation de vos enfants et à leurs contacts répétés avec les perturbateurs endocriniens contenus dans les aliments conditionnés en boîte, aux contacts avec toutes formes de plastiques et choisissez des vêtements adaptés, plutôt amples. Pour les bébés, proscrivez les jouets et tétines en plastique, privilégiez les cuillères en bois simple. Ne donnez pas de petits pots pour bébé mais des aliments que vous préparerez vous-même, si possible biologiques ou issus d’un potager non traité aux pesticides, herbicides et autres intrants chimiques toxiques. Certes, cette préparation demande du temps quotidien mais les conséquences sont autrement importantes… Je ne peux détailler sur cette question, il me faudrait un livre entier. Les pratiques sportives sont aussi essentielles. Je n’évoquerai même pas la majorité des garçons qui n’ont presque aucune activité sportive (une catastrophe sanitaire) alors qu’ils passent 6 à 7 heures par jour assis sur une chaise en pleine période de développement, puis le reste de la journée devant la télévision ou l’ordinateur. N’espérez pas avoir des enfants sains avec ce régime de vie. Ils seront des cibles et, consciemment ou non, se retrancheront de la vie réelle pour fuir des rapports de force auxquels ils ne sont pas préparés. Pour vos garçons, privilégiez dès 6 ans des activités de contact (rugby, etc.) et, d’une façon générale, le contact direct avec la difficulté, la nature, le froid, le chaud, le piquant, aussi souvent que possible. Non dans une perspective de souffrance, et en songeant toujours que vous devez valoriser sans le plaindre ses échecs et ses bosses.

""Con questa azione - inizia la nota del movimento - abbiamo sottolineato come nessun tipo di divieto o imposizione possa limitare il nostro diritto a fare politica. Abbiamo così voluto lanciare un messaggio forte e chiaro a chiunque pensi che delle prescrizioni possano buttarci fuori dall'agone politico"". ""Non possiamo cedere a questa lettura della realtà - continua la nota - che vede come 'nemica' e 'pericolosa' ogni affermazione di vitalità contraria a questo status quo.

""Impedire ad una realtà giovanile di manifestare solo per paura delle sigle antifasciste - conclude la nota - significa ammettere l'impotenza dello Stato di fronte a questo metodo mafioso.

Quand elle n’était pas communiste, elle se voulait plutôt libérale parce qu’anticommuniste et son patriotisme était fortement teinté d’économisme. Mais, avec la mondialisation, le paradigme, dominant, en économie libérale, présuppose que toute évolution du marché conduit à l’équilibre. Loin d’atteindre cet équilibre, l’auteur montre que la mondialisation, au lieu d’ouvrir les chemins de la liberté, a conduit les peuples sur les routes d’une nouvelle servitude et à la naissance d’une nomenklatura mondialiste. Pire encore, le nouveau capitalisme est en passe de se débarrasser de la démocratie et de la puissance publique. « Au-dessus de ceux-là s’élève un pouvoir immense et tutélaire, que ne peut-il leur ôter entièrement le trouble de penser et la peine de vivre… » Voilà que l’on découvre que cette phrase de Tocqueville, ordinairement utilisée contre les totalitarismes du XXe siècle, s’applique parfaitement à la sournoise tyrannie que la mondialisation est en train de nous concocter.

Il faut perdre très vite, le plus tôt possible pour avoir sa carte de membre et l'onction de pureté. L'espoir leur semble vain car leur royaume n'est pas de ce monde.

Qu'il faut être précis, réfléchir, sortir des slogans, de la mythomanie et des poses. Mais ils n'écoutent rien.

Une formidable aventure scientifique démarre alors. Son objectif : recueillir un maximum de données sur les centaines de tonnes de matériaux qui jonchent le sol. Bois de charpente, pierres, métaux, etc. sont ainsi triés, répertoriés, stockés en vue d'être sauvegardés, étudiés, analysés et parfois réemployés. Une véritable auscultation du monument blessé est menée par neuf groupes composés de scientifiques issus d'une cinquantaine de laboratoires – historiens, archéologues, anthropologues, acousticiens, informaticiens et spécialistes des matériaux. Leur mission est double : réaliser un travail de recherche sur la mémoire de la cathédrale et accompagner le grand chantier de restauration mené par les architectes et compagnons sous la supervision du maître d'ouvrage. Ce livre, illustré d'images exceptionnelles, permet de comprendre comment Notre-Dame a été pensée, bâtie, rénovée en revisitant notre connaissance du monument à chaque période de son histoire. L'ouvrage revient aussi sur l'épisode traumatique de l'incendie et sur la formidable mobilisation nationale et internationale qu'il a suscitée. Il nous plonge enfin dans sa mémoire foisonnante, jalonnée de rencontres avec les plus grands noms de la culture, de la technique, de la littérature et de l'art en général.",2024-11-28 08:20:16+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/43328,,,778,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.473.user.Zentropa451.post.43291,1187228866,Zentropa451,43291,,"⚠️ NOVITÀ IN LIBRERIA ⚠️ Nato a Husi il 13 settembre 1899, Corneliu Codreanu fu senza dubbio il più atipico dei Capi politici del periodo tra le due guerre, nonché uno dei più carismatici. Nel 1927, fondò la Legione dell’Arcangelo Michele – meglio conosciuta come Guardia di Ferro – e ne fu il “Capitano”: tra mille sacrifici e altrettante avversità, dimostrò di aver dato vita ad un progetto dotato di una propria dottrina, di una propria prassi organizzativa e di un proprio modello politico. Le sue Camicie Verdi – infatti – ambivano alla creazione di un “uomo nuovo” e di un “nuovo ordine”, la cui mistica religiosa e soprannaturale si reggeva su una rigorosa morale cristiana, sul profondo senso del dovere, su un’ascesi costante e verticale, sulla ferrea disciplina dello spirito legionario, su un forte e tenace attaccamento alla Patria e su un autentico senso della Comunità di popolo. Codreanu – il cui nome giunse in Italia attraverso la penna di autorevoli giornalisti – esortava i suoi compatrioti a condurre una vita eroica, radicata nella consapevolezza dell’identità dacica e latina. Odiato dal re e dalla classe politica del suo Paese, egli fu al centro della vita politica romena fino alla sua tragica esecuzione, avvenuta nella notte tra il 29 e il 30 novembre 1938 per ordine del governo del re Carol II, quando il Capitano aveva appena 39 anni. Questa biografia, unica nel suo genere, ripercorre la vita e il pensiero di una delle più complesse figure del XX secolo.

Dépolitiser la politique, c’est en faire une technique de gestion administrative (la « gouvernance ») : les problèmes politiques ne seraient que des questions techniques, où les hommes pourraient être gouvernés à la façon dont on administre les choses. Dépolitiser l’homme, c’est le concevoir comme essentiellement mû par ses seuls intérêts privés. Dépolitiser la religion, c’est en faire un domaine privé vis-à-vis duquel l’État doit rester neutre (c’est le principe de laïcité). Dépolitiser la guerre, c’est la transformer en croisade morale. Dépolitiser la sexualité, c’est croire que tous les individus sont sexuellement neutres et qu’en ce domaine ils peuvent intégralement se « construire » eux-mêmes. Dépolitiser l’humanité, c’est la considérer comme constituée d’individus qui sont tous fondamentalement les mêmes (l’« unité du monde » au service de la dépolitisation). Dépolitiser la société, c’est en faire une manufacture de l’homme apolitique, désaffilié (aucun sujet ne le guide), aux affects neutralisés au nom du « raisonnable » ».

Cette interdiction, invoquant des « risques de troubles à l’ordre public », cède une fois de plus aux menaces de groupes violents et à la pression de l’extrême-gauche, plutôt que de garantir les libertés fondamentales, dont le droit de manifester.

Nous refusons d’être assimilés à des mouvements marginaux ou violents. Nous ne laisserons pas cette décision arbitraire empêcher les Français de se faire entendre. En interdisant notre rassemblement, c’est une voix citoyenne légitime qu’on tente de faire taire, ainsi que la peine et les inquiétudes de milliers de jeunes Français qui se reconnaissent dans ces tragédies.

Il disait une chose merveilleuse. Il rappelait que Mozart n’avait jamais su pour qui il avait écrit son Requiem. Et le philosophe d’imaginer qu’il l’avait écrit pour Marie-Antoinette, qu’il avait connue, quand ils avaient sept et huit ans, et que Mozart avait fait rire et qu’il avait consolée. Pierre Boutang continuait : «Pour que Marie-Antoinette n’entendît pas le bruit de la charrette qui l’amenait à l’échafaud, Mozart a forgé ce Requiem, qui est la musique qu’elle a dû entendre jusqu’à son dernier souffle, comme on entend la musique des sphères, comme on entend la musique des anges.» Stéphane Barsacq",2024-11-25 09:04:20+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/43180,,,932,0,6,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,video/mp4,5.918060305019049e+18,220.28770975057,IMG_1418.MP4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alain Pascal nous livre ici un ouvrage iconoclaste, mais rigoureusement documenté, qui invite à une profonde réflexion sur l’Histoire et ses récits officiels. Selon l’auteur, les Temps modernes, inaugurés par la Révolution, représentent une tragique parenthèse de l’Histoire. En effaçant l’héritage de l’intelligence chrétienne — seule voie offrant à l’humanité la liberté véritable et la raison —, ils ont précipité la régression vers la barbarie. Pour camoufler cette dégradation, universités et médias entretiennent les illusions des Lumières : un Moyen Âge obscurantiste, une Renaissance salvatrice, une philosophie moderne rationnelle et une ère de progrès issue de la Révolution. Pourquoi ces mensonges perdurent-ils ? Parce que la véritable Histoire, celle qui révèle la Vérité religieuse, contredit ces fictions. Pour Pascal, l’Histoire ne commence pas avec la Révolution, mais avec la Révélation du Dieu de la Bible, dont le Christ, Fils incarné, s’est sacrifié pour l’humanité. À l’inverse, la Révolution marque un retour aux cultes antiques exigeant des sacrifices humains. Ainsi, le monde moderne se fonde non seulement sur le mensonge, mais aussi sur une violence sacrificielle qui a ensanglanté le XXe siècle, et dont les dérives pourraient s’aggraver sous la dictature mondialiste. Réviser l’Histoire est donc une tâche urgente. Car, loin d’être une affaire purement politique, l’Histoire est d’essence religieuse, depuis toujours et sans exception. Cet ouvrage invite le lecteur à « faire table rase de la table rase », car l’avenir de la France, de l’Europe, et de la civilisation chrétienne occidentale est menacé par des forces occultes et diaboliques qui dominent le monde contemporain.",2024-11-24 21:11:21+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/43177,,,970,0,7,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Attraverso una serie di contributi straordinari, critici, studiosi e nipponisti indagano molti dei temi centrali del pensiero di Mishima: l’estetica della bellezza, la tensione tra tradizione e modernità, l’ossessione per la disciplina fisica e spirituale, il conflitto tra eros e thanatos. La raccolta affronta anche l’impatto della politica e dell’identità giapponese sull’opera di Mishima, analizzando romanzi come Il Padiglione d’oro, Confessioni di una Maschera, Patriottismo, La difesa della cultura e Lezioni spirituali per giovani samurai, approfondendo le influenze culturali, filosofiche e autobiografiche che permeano la sua produzione letteraria. Ogni saggio si propone di offrire nuovi spunti utili a cogliere tutte le più complesse sfumature di un autore che visse un’intera esistenza come un’opera d’arte e un ultimo istante come estremo atto di coerenza. La fascinazione di Mishima per l’Occidente è ben nota. Indossava abiti italiani di classe e fumava sigari cubani. Quando costruì la sua sfarzosa abitazione nel 1958, confidò come spunto allegorico al suo architetto di volersi sedere su una sedia in stile rococò vestito in jeans e camicia hawaiana. Il risultato del suo progetto architettonico fu un mélange di statue greche e mobili d’epoca francesi degni di un set cinematografico, tra lo sconcerto di molti giapponesi che ricevettero inviti ai suoi cocktail party su cartoline marchiate Tiffany. Era un avido lettore di penne del calibro notevole, tra cui Gide e Cocteau, Novalis, Henry Miller, Fitzgerald, Truman Capote ed Hemingway, che ammirava in modo stravagante. Ma sebbene il suo stile di vita fosse irreprensibilmente esterofilo almeno in superficie, nelle sue esternazioni più intime esprimeva sempre lo stesso grido di lamento. E il 25 novembre 1970 consegnò all’“ambivalenza culturale” il tributo finale, quando si suicidò nel modo più giapponese che si possa immaginare, commettendo seppuku.",2024-11-21 19:39:07+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/43046,,,799,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.741.user.Zentropa451.post.43020,1187228866,Zentropa451,43020,,"Egregio Direttore, Le scrivo in merito al corteo del nostro movimento giovanile, il Blocco Studentesco, che era stato regolarmente preavvisato agli organi competenti e che doveva tenersi il prossimo 30 novembre a Milano. Il corteo è stato vietato e ci sono state notificate delle prescrizioni dal Questore, con delle motivazioni che non sono solo oggettivamente paradossali, ma che ledono ampiamente la libertà di espressione e quella di manifestare. In particolare, la possibilità che centri sociali, anarchici e realtà antagoniste organizzino delle contro-manifestazioni non autorizzate che degenerino in disordini non può rappresentare un impedimento ad un movimento qualsiasi di scendere in piazza. Un movimento, in questo caso CasaPound, che esiste da 20 anni, ha migliaia di iscritti su tutto il territorio nazionale, opera alla luce del sole, fa politica, cultura, solidarietà. In CasaPound ci sono lavoratori, madri e padri, studenti, disoccupati, precari, che, fino a prova contraria, hanno gli stessi diritti di tutti gli altri. Non mi risulta infatti, che siano in atto procedimenti per lo scioglimento o per la messa al bando di una realtà che ad oggi non viola nessuna legge, anzi per anni si è presentata col proprio simbolo a competizioni elettorali di ogni livello, dalle amministrative fino alle europee. Perché o si decide che CasaPound va sciolta, e non lo può certo disporre a suo piacimento una parte politica che non tollera la nostra esistenza, oppure qui siamo di fronte a un ricatto. Addirittura nelle motivazioni del divieto si fa riferimento a 18 anni fa, quando nel 2006 a Milano, a fronte di una manifestazione della Fiamma Tricolore, che tra l’altro si svolse senza disordini di alcun tipo, i centri sociali misero a ferro e fuoco la città, rovesciando persino delle auto in corso Buenos Aires. Siamo di fronte a un metodo che rasenta quello mafioso e da uomini liberi, quali ci consideriamo, non possiamo né approvarlo, né sopportarlo. Siamo di fronte a quello che potrebbe diventare un precedente pericoloso, che oggi colpisce CasaPound, ma che in un futuro nemmeno troppo distante potrebbe estendersi a qualsiasi movimento o partito non allineato al pensiero dominante o all’orientamento politico di chi amministra una qualsiasi città. Chiaramente alla base del divieto c’è quanto accaduto il 9 novembre a Bologna ed il dibattito che ne è scaturito. La domanda di fondo, se è giusto che CasaPound possa manifestare o no, è profondamente sbagliata. Ed è davvero incoerente e irragionevole che sia sollevata da chi ci accusa continuamente di violare la Costituzione e la democrazia. Le domande che chiunque è in buonafede dovrebbe porsi su Bologna sono ben altre: perché sono state permesse altre tre manifestazioni che avevano intenti chiari, non distanti dal percorso del nostro corteo, che eppure era stato già preavvisato con largo anticipo? Perché ai centri sociali è stato consentito di avvicinarsi così tanto a piazza XX Settembre dove doveva svolgersi il nostro comizio? Perché sono stati fermati da appena 7 poliziotti, mentre noi ne eravamo circondati? Solo grazie al nostro senso di responsabilità si è evitato il peggio quel giorno, ma se si continua su questa linea, negandoci il sacrosanto diritto di manifestare, si rischia di tornare ad anni di tensione e allo scontro politico di piazza, che già in passato hanno portato conseguenze tragiche per l’Italia. Per questo oggi lanciamo un appello e chiediamo a giornalisti, intellettuali, politici e rappresentanti istituzionali di prendere una posizione affinché il corteo del Blocco Studentesco il 30 novembre a Milano sia consentito. E prendere posizione in questo caso non vuol dire condividere le nostre idee radicali o la nostra visione del mondo, ma difendere un principio di giustizia e di libertà. Perché è la libertà che è in ballo e non solo la nostra. Perché non possono esistere nel 2024 città ancora ostaggio di uno stantio antifascismo istituzionale e non.",2024-11-21 09:10:02+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/43020,,,787,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Malgré un préavis suffisant et un précédent cortège organisé en avril à Vérone par des centaines de jeunes sans aucun incident, la Questura a décidé de nous empêcher de manifester pour des raisons qui ne tiennent compte que de la tension ""possible"" que les réalités antifascistes pourraient créer. Il s'agit en fait de représailles après le défilé de CasaPound Italia à Bologne, qui a déclenché toute l'hystérie de la gauche à l'encontre de notre monde. Il est inacceptable qu'un seul parti politique soit autorisé à manifester dans les rues. Notre mouvement participe activement à la politique dans les écoles depuis près de vingt ans et au grand jour. Dans les raisons invoquées par la Questura, nous ne trouvons pas une seule raison valable, mais seulement le désir de ne pas contrarier l'ANPI, les antagonistes et les différents collectifs. Voulez-vous nous faire croire que la police et la ville doivent être les otages des antifascistes alors que la rue est l'apanage exclusif de la gauche ? Voulez-vous nous faire croire que la deuxième ville d'Italie n'est pas capable de gérer un mois de novembre étudiant normal ?

Nous ne considérons pas ces raisons comme inadmissibles ou déplacées, mais comme légitimes au même titre que celles des autres. Nous voulons manifester pour une école sociale, identitaire et de la jeunesse : notre génération peut elle aussi apporter ses idées au débat sur l'avenir des jeunes et ne peut pas en être exclue par la force des armes"".

Dans cette autobiographie dantesque, écrite à l’instinct, le réalisateur revient pour la première fois sur les épisodes marquants de son parcours : les tournages chaotiques devenus légendaires (Aguirre, Fitzcarraldo…), la collaboration explosive avec Klaus Kinski, mais aussi son enfance dans les décombres de l’Allemagne d’après-guerre, son amitié avec Bruce Chatwin, les dizaines de fois où il a frôlé la mort, son travail avec la Nasa, son expérience de cavalier de rodéo dans les arènes mexicaines, les stratagèmes mis en œuvre pour boucler in extremis le financement de ses films… Au fil des pages, Herzog égraine ainsi, avec cet art du récit et du montage qui ont fait sa renommée, les clés d’une filmographie intransigeante et viscérale.

Il coraggio dei suoi guerrieri, la vita frugale, il senso dello Stato e la disciplina quotidiana dei suoi cittadini erano i tratti distintivi di una Comunità organica che sembrava disprezzare il lusso e la banalità, incarnando una verticalità essenziale che ha lasciato un segno indelebile. Possiamo ancora trarre degli insegnamenti da questa città guerriera, oppure i suoi precetti sono diventati troppo impegnativi per il mondo moderno? Per rispondere alle tante domande che accompagnano l’analisi di questa Civiltà così discussa, Frédéric Éparvier ripercorre la storia di Sparta dalle origini alla sua caduta, illustrando le ragioni del suo periodo d’oro e le cause del suo declino. Uno viaggio straordinario e appassionato – frutto di uno studio accurato e versatile – nella perenne grandezza delle radici europee.

Nonostante un larghissimo preavviso e un precedente corteo, in aprile a Verona svolto senza nessun tipo di incidenti da centinaia di giovani, la Questura ha deciso di impedirci di manifestare per motivazioni che tengono conto solo della ""possibile"" tensione che potrebbero creare le realtà antifasciste. Questa sembra a tutti gli effetti una ritorsione dopo il corteo di CasaPound Italia a Bologna, che ha visto scatenarsi tutta l'isteria della sinistra nei confronti del nostro mondo. ""È inaccettabile che ad una sola parte politica venga concesso di manifestare nelle strade. Il nostro movimento fa politica attiva nelle scuole da quasi vent'anni e alla luce del sole. Nelle motivazioni addotte dalla Questura non troviamo una sola ragione valida ma solo la volontà di non indisporre ANPI, antagonisti e collettivi vari. Ci state forse dicendo che le forze dell'ordine e le città devono essere ostaggio degli antifascisti mentre le strade appannaggio esclusivo della sinistra? Ci volete far credere che la seconda città d'Italia non è in grado di gestire un normale novembre studentesco? Questo è un precedente davvero pericoloso e deve far drizzare le antenne a chiunque abbia a cuore la pluralità del dibattito politico in Italia"". ""Noi vogliamo fare un corteo studentesco pacifico ma risoluto che rivendichi i diritti degli studenti a fronte di una scuola-azienda che non ci piace; di un clima economico che rende città come Roma e Milano le più costose in Europa per gli studenti universitari; di un sistema scolastico sempre più privatizzato e disumano. Non ci sembrano ragioni irricevibili o fuori luogo ma legittime tanto quanto quelle degli altri. Vogliamo manifestare per una scuola sociale, identitaria e giovanile: anche la nostra generazione può contribuire con le sue idee al dibattito sul futuro dei giovani e non può semplicemente esserne esclusa d'imperio"". ""Non siamo disposti ad accettare la parte dei cattivi ma siamo pronti a fare scudo sui diritti che ci siamo conquistati con tanti anni di sindacalismo studentesco. A qualsiasi tentativo di buttarci fuori dall'agone politico risponderemo sempre con la forza tranquilla di un principio adamantino: non esistono città dove i nostri studenti non possono manifestare"".",2024-11-20 10:08:03+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/42971,,,743,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.860.user.Zentropa451.post.42901,1187228866,Zentropa451,42901,,"On connaît la présence de nombreuses fumeries d’opium entre 1890 et 1916 – année de l’interdiction de cette drogue – dans les grands ports français, comme Toulon ou Brest. Les 300 que l’on pouvait trouver à Paris restent bien plus mystérieuses. Situés dans les beaux quartiers, autour de la place de l’Étoile notamment, mais aussi dans des bouges comme ceux de la place Maubert, ces lieux d’extase et de perdition étaient fréquentés par une faune avide d’évasion : de l’élite artistique, littéraire ou mondaine jusqu’aux bas-fonds de la capitale. En 1907, l’écrivain et journaliste Delphi Fabrice réussit à se faire introduire dans la plupart de ces fumeries parisiennes. Son récit de ce milieu jusqu’alors secret constitue le cœur de ce recueil. Il est précédé d’une introduction d’une rare érudition sur une époque où l’exotisme nourrissait nombre de fantasmes. Il est complété par des enquêtes parues dans la presse qui dépeignent les mœurs et les atmosphères envoûtantes de ces lieux et qui brossent des portraits stupéfiants de fumeurs et de tenanciers. Ces textes, d’une belle qualité littéraire et documentaire, illustrés par une riche iconographie, font revivre un monde disparu, où les paradis artificiels se confondaient avec un enfer réel.",2024-11-18 18:54:59+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/42901,,,887,0,3,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nata per accompagnare la celebrazione del Solstizio d’Inverno, la lanterna di Yule è molto diffusa nei Paesi nordici, dove incarna la trasmissione di un retaggio antico e profondo, dalla forte carica spiritua- le e folkloristica. Il presente modello, forgiato su una copia risalente agli inizi dello scorso secolo, presenta quattro facce decorate: ciascuna di esse contiene un cuore che sormonta una runa di Hagal, simbolicamente chiamata ad armonizzare la Vita e la Morte e a prefigurare – nell’immagine del sole a sei raggi e della “ruota dell’anno” – la continuità tra il vecchio e il nuovo, nel solco della circolarità e del perpetuo ritorno. I simboli, scolpiti nella terracotta, permettono di intravedere la luce proveniente dalla candela interna, che assieme a quella esterna rappresenta il ciclo vitale che si esaurisce e si rinnova. Usata come dono rituale, la lanterna ha una funzione propiziatoria e ben augurale: oltre alla celebrazione solstiziale – infatti – veniva donata in occasione dei matrimoni e dei grandi eventi, andando a decorare un angolo importante della casa e contribuendo a vaporizzare l’ambiente attraverso l’applicazione di oli essenziali. La riedizione di questo oggetto – realizzato dalle sapienti mani di un artigiano – vuole essere un piccolo contributo alla conoscenza e alla valorizzazione della lunga memoria europea: dinanzi alle derive dello sradicamento globale e del progressismo livellante, diventa necessario custodire e trasmettere la preziosa eredità dei nostri antenati, riaffermando la tensione verso il sacro, la potenza ancestrale della nostra identità e la perenne armonia con il Cosmos.

Ils ont passé la matinée en pyjama dehors le temps que les pompiers éteignent le feu, le père s'étant brûlé aux mains et aux pieds en luttant vainement contre l'incendie de sa maison. À part un sac à main et un violon, ils ont absolument tout perdu, et sans de bons amis pour les loger ils dormiraient dehors cette nuit. Une cagnotte a été lancée pour les aider. Je vous demande de tout mon cœur de ne pas lésiner : c'est dans ces moments là que le slogan ""les nôtres avant les autres"" peut être mis en pratique et prendre tout son sens.

Les élites ont résolument choisi leur camp, celui des « Anywhere », en s’appuyant sur une police de plus en plus politique. 👉🏻 À retrouver dans le dernier numéro d’Éléments, en kiosque et sur www.revue-elements.com",2024-11-14 15:32:03+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/42777,,,1096,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.1007.user.Zentropa451.post.42751,1187228866,Zentropa451,42751,,""" Bayard, d'Artagnan, le chevalier d'Éon ; ces figures de bretteurs racontent des histoires différentes, mais néanmoins reliées entre elles par le fil d'une lame. Le chevalier, le duelliste et l'escrimeur sont autant d'archétypes qui révèlent qu'à l'époque moderne l'épée est une culture. Ce livre entreprend d'en explorer tous les aspects : du geste de l'escrimeur aux valeurs qui lui sont associées. C'est en effet à partir de la Renaissance que les techniques de l'escrime deviennent un art guidé par des principes savants et moraux. L'analyse des valeurs impliquées dans cet art permet aussi de suivre l'évolution des idéaux de la noblesse qui fait de l'épée le vecteur de son identité. Il ne faudrait, toutefois, pas oublier que l'art de vivre l'épée à la main reste, de part en part, un art de tuer. À une époque où le port d'une arme blanche est une pratique courante, l'escrime civile et civilisée ne saurait occulter les cadavres abandonnés par les innombrables duellistes. C'est pourquoi l'histoire de l'épée est aussi une histoire de la violence et de l'inaltérable fascination qu'elle exerce. Pour le découvrir, il faut alors plonger dans les archives d'une justice souvent prompte à occulter ce crime qui trouble l'image d'un roi absolument maître de ses sujets. Une autre vision du rapport entre violence et civilisation se dessine de cette façon. """,2024-11-14 07:21:00+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/42751,,,831,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Les bouleversements géopolitiques rendent de nouveau crédible l'hypothèse d'un conflit entre les principales puissances mondiales. Sur terre. Et sur les mers. Attaques de navires occidentaux par les missiles des Houthis le long des côtes de la mer Rouge, montée en puissance phénoménale de la Marine chinoise, présence accrue des sous-marins russes aux abords de l'Europe… Les espaces maritimes et océaniques, que l'on avait pris l'habitude de considérer comme des domaines internationaux relativement sanctuarisés depuis la fin de la Guerre froide, sont de nouveau des territoires de conflictualité potentielle. Dans le même temps, la crise du Covid a remis en lumière l'exposition de nos économies aux routes maritimes, que cela concerne le réseau mondial des câbles internet ou le transport des marchandises. Satellites, aéronefs, navires de surface, sous-marins et drones : alors que se referme définitivement l'ère des dividendes de la paix, les principaux acteurs de l'échiquier international développent à marche forcée des outils navals puissants, et cherchent à maîtriser un panel de missions complexes, allant de la protection des ressources à la dissuasion nucléaire. Cet ouvrage, qui croise les évolutions stratégiques et doctrinales des trente dernières années avec le rôle que tiennent les nouvelles technologies, permet de comprendre ce qui se joue actuellement, de l'espace extra-atmosphérique jusqu'aux fonds marins, en passant par le retour potentiel du combat de surface.

Cette évolution a commencé à la fin de la deuxième guerre mondiale, et s'est développée dans les années 1970 en accumulant les sanctions contre les contrevenants. Création de l'esprit occidental avec toutes les influences qu'il reçu au cours de son histoire, un corpus d'idées s'est constitué. Ces développements ont eu et auront de lourdes conséquences sur les comportements des peuples européens et américains du nord. Il convient donc de faire une critique objective, de ces éléments constitutifs et à ses conséquences. L'auteur fait un inventaire critique de cette norme qui exploite le flou de la sémantique et l'absence de définition claire. Quelles ont été les réactions à son installation au coeur de la pensée européenne et ses conséquences.

Che cosa spinge l’uomo, o la donna, a cominciare un viaggio lungo mesi, percorrendo migliaia di chilometri a piedi e passando infinite giornate sotto il sole e la pioggia? Perché l’essere umano moderno, schiavo dell’automobile, delle comodità e della tecnologia, decide di passare un periodo in pellegrinaggio? La risposta a queste domande, spesso e volentieri, si trova proprio sulla strada. Renato Romano, autore di “Giorno dopo giorno”, torna a Roma dopo cinque anni dall’arrivo nella Città Imperiale attraverso la Via Francigena, per ripartire verso quella che – secondo lui – è l’unica destinazione possibile. In questa prima parte del lungo pellegrinaggio verso la Terra Santa, Renato descrive e documenta il percorso, la terra e le genti genuine che si trovano tra il Sud Italia e i Balcani. Attraverso le antiche direttrici romane, i cammini tradizionali e il torrido asfalto delle strade più trafficate, l’autore ci porta con sé nel suo viaggio straordinario, fitto di aneddoti e imprevisti, conoscenze e infiniti chilometri a piedi sulle Vie d’Europa.

Quand elle n’était pas communiste, elle se voulait plutôt libérale parce qu’anticommuniste et son patriotisme était fortement teinté d’économisme. Mais, avec la mondialisation, le paradigme, dominant, en économie libérale, présuppose que toute évolution du marché conduit à l’équilibre. Loin d’atteindre cet équilibre, l’auteur montre que la mondialisation, au lieu d’ouvrir les chemins de la liberté, a conduit les peuples sur les routes d’une nouvelle servitude et à la naissance d’une nomenklatura mondialiste. Pire encore, le nouveau capitalisme est en passe de se débarrasser de la démocratie et de la puissance publique. « Au-dessus de ceux-là s’élève un pouvoir immense et tutélaire, que ne peut-il leur ôter entièrement le trouble de penser et la peine de vivre… » Voilà que l’on découvre que cette phrase de Tocqueville, ordinairement utilisée contre les totalitarismes du XXe siècle, s’applique parfaitement à la sournoise tyrannie que la mondialisation est en train de nous concocter.

Malgré la gêne... Parce que comme tous les ans, l'héroïsme de nos aïeux ne parvient pas à enlever de ma bouche et de mon esprit quelque chose de pâteux, que la mascarade républicaine rend vite urticant. Certes, ils sont morts en se battant pour la France, comme le rappellent les élus de tout le pays au pied des monuments aux morts. Mais qui aura profité vraiment de cette boucherie européenne, sinon les affairistes les plus retors et les idéologies qui devaient, dans un choc de titans quelques années plus tard, faire vaciller un peu plus notre civilisation en engloutissant au passage quelques millions de vies supplémentaires ? Non, ce goût métallique et pâteux ne s'en va pas. Aucune pommade patriotique ne fait passer la tristesse infinie que provoquent en moi les photos en noir et blancs de ces jeunes hommes sacrifiés. Tout, jusqu'à la boue de notre novembre tiède et humide qui colle à mes chaussures, me rappelle ces ventres éclatés, les chairs pourrissantes et le sang inutilement versé. Pires encore que le souvenir de ces horreurs que je n'ai pas vécues me semblent ces accents de patriotisme républicain dont débordent nos politiciens. Les mêmes accents farouches des mêmes ordures pourries qui, il y a 110 ans déjà, envoyaient au casse-pipe des millions de pauvres gars, qui pour une large part partaient en chantant des hymnes ""catholiques et français toujours"" dans l'esprit, alors que la lie maçonnique tirerait encore une fois ses marrons de la flamme du soldat inconnu. En ce 11 novembre qui précède d'autres massacres plus grands et plus laids encore, les Français doivent évidemment se souvenir, célébrer l'héroïsme, bâtir un pays plus fort, et plus beau encore. Mais pour que le sacrifice des héros ne soit pas vain, il faudrait, outre être prêt à mourir pour notre pays, vivre un peu pour lui déjà, et un peu moins pour nos petites gueules. Mais surtout : enterrer à jamais ces fausses valeurs qu'on entend invoquer de plus en plus ces derniers temps, et dont les chantres ne se réveillent le plus souvent que pour envoyer une nouvelle fournée de Michel et de Dupont grossir les listes des monuments aux morts.

I completely understand the sympathy that certain Trump positions can generate in »nationalist« circles. The support shown by Giorgia Meloni and Viktor Orbán is equally understandable. But does this mean Trump should be taken as an example? I don't believe so for a moment, as political life is so different in America compared to this side of the Atlantic. Just as Black Africans are not Europeans with darker skin, Americans are not English-speaking Europeans. The deep reasons for Donald Trump's success relate to realities very foreign to Europe. The role played by an Elon Musk, the place of evangelical Christians (and Christian Zionists) who idolize the Bible and Constitution, the brutal tone of Trump's interventions – none of this has an equivalent in Europe. Lazy minds react emotionally to keywords – immigration, wokeness, etc. – but only see one aspect of things. Any attempt to do »like Trump« in Europe is, in my opinion, doomed to failure. Europeans should rather worry about what America wanting to regain its »greatness« means for us. If it does regain it, that's when they'll be truly threatened. ✍️ Das Interview kann hier gelesen werden: https://nouvelledroite.substack.com/p/analysis-of-trumps-victory-an-interview 📚 Die Bücher von Alain de Benoist gibt es hier: https://www.jungeuropa.de/autoren/alain-de-benoist/",2024-11-10 20:54:24+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/42551,,,906,0,5,1,PeerChannel,1489870038.0,jungeuropa,2024-11-10 15:48:39,2024-11-10,https://t.me/jungeuropa/2372,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dopo un blocco delle forze dell’ordine in prossimità di piazza XX settembre, la piazza è stata raggiunta e in un lato della stessa si sono susseguiti gli interventi, come era stato previsto e autorizzato”. “Intendiamo inoltre, esprimere solidarietà al passante, assolutamente estraneo a tutto il contesto, che è stato vigliaccamente aggredito dai collettivi. La giornata di ieri ha visto da una parte 700 manifestanti della Rete dei Patrioti e di CasaPound sfilare ordinatamente per le strade di Bologna per rivendicare sicurezza e contro il degrado di una città allo sbando, dall'altra altrettanti militanti antifascisti che hanno aggredito passanti e si sono scontrati con la polizia, non riuscendo nemmeno a sfondare un cordone di soli 7 poliziotti, temendo forse che, oltre il cordone, la loro provocazione sarebbe giustamente stata respinta e loro sorte sarebbe stata peggiore. La cosa che rattrista di più noi, come ogni cittadino bolognese che ama la propria città, è che questa feccia non solo sia stata fomentata da amministrazione comunale, ANPI e Partito Democratico, con in testa Elly Schlein, ma vedeva tra le proprie fila un consigliere comunale e nientemeno che il vicesindaco. Bologna merita decisamente di meglio”. “Per quanto ci riguarda, non possono esistere città ostaggio dei centri sociali e di uno stantio antifascismo istituzionale e non: continueremo a scendere in piazza e a replicare queste manifestazioni al fianco degli italiani che non si sono ancora arresi, in ogni città della nostra nazione, che non possiamo lasciare morire sotto i colpi delle scelte ideologiche e del malaffare della politica”.",2024-11-10 20:51:20+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/42549,,,760,0,0,1,PeerChannel,1226866970.0,casapoundufficiale,2024-11-10 17:03:18,2024-11-10,https://t.me/casapoundufficiale/5110,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Le soutien que lui manifestent Giorgia Meloni et Viktor Orbán est tout aussi compréhensible. Mais cela signifie-t-il que Trump doit être pris comme exemple ? Je ne le crois pas un instant tant la vie politique est différente en Amérique et de ce côté-ci de l’Atlantique. De même que les Noirs africains ne sont pas des Européens à la peau plus foncée, les Américains ne sont pas des Européens qui parlent anglais. Les raisons profondes du succès de Donald Trump renvoient à des réalités très étrangères à l’Europe. Le rôle joué par un Elon Musk, la place des chrétiens évangéliques (et des sionistes chrétiens), qui idolâtrent la Bible et la Constitution, la tonalité brutale des interventions trumpiennes, tout cela n’a pas d’équivalent en Europe. Les esprits paresseux réagissent affectivement à des mots-clés, immigration, wokisme, etc., mais ne voient qu’un aspect des choses. Toute tentative de faire « comme Trump » en Europe est à mon avis vouée à l’échec. Les Européens devraient plutôt s’inquiéter de ce que signifie pour nous le fait que l’Amérique veuille retrouver sa « grandeur ». Si elle la retrouve, c’est alors qu’ils seront vraiment menacés.""

msg_iteration.1242.user.Zentropa451.post.42514,1187228866,Zentropa451,42514,,"En août 1925, moins d’un an après la parution du Manifeste du Surréalisme, Pierre Drieu la Rochelle publie « La Véritable erreur des surréalistes » dans La Nouvelle revue française. C’est la première des trois lettres ouvertes que Drieu adresse au groupe d’avant-garde dont il est le témoin attentif depuis 1916, et sa rencontre décisive avec Louis Aragon. En sa compagnie, le futur auteur de Gilles et du Feu follet participe à l’aventure Dada à Paris, à celle de la revue Littérature, et à la naissance du surréalisme. Ses Trois lettres aux surréalistes révèlent qu’il a failli tout miser sur le mouvement d’André Breton, au cœur de ses « Années folles » qui furent des années de crise. Mais vingt ans avant son suicide, une première déception l’attendait : la « petite bande » qui avait pris une position littéraire radicale préparait son ralliement au communisme. En 1927, les faits lui ayant donné raison, Drieu compose deux autres lettres magistrales pour sa revue polémique, Les Derniers jours. Entre argumentation et méditation, pamphlet et supplication, les Trois lettres établissent, pour la première fois, les préoccupations qui seront au cœur de son œuvre et de sa vie : la question de la solitude et de l’amitié, celle de la pensée et de l’action. Elles affirment la véritable quête idéaliste de Pierre Drieu la Rochelle, celle d’une esthétique littéraire permettant « d’agir à fond » dans son époque. Une quête qui s’affrontera aux dilemmes de l’Histoire.",2024-11-09 16:18:32+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/42514,,,899,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tourné un an avant le drame du Heysel, il s'agit du seul film français à évoquer le hooliganisme et ses hordes de supporters sombrant dans la violence. L'objectif du cinéaste est plus de condamner la violence autour du football que de présenter le mode de vie des supporters les plus violents. Les puristes s'étrangleront du look des fans jaunes et noirs, ni ultras, ni hooligans, de même à la vision de Michel Serrault en chef de bande et homme médiocre. Les supporters sont ici plus campés en bougres adeptes d'une violence spontanée qu'en professionnels de la bagarre. Pourtant, certainement le meilleur film du genre en ce qui concerne la mise en place des mécanismes de violence spontanée des foules. Pour la petite histoire, les scènes du stade furent tournées dans l'antre du Football Club de Rouen qui manque à l'élite du football français. Une réussite !

Questa la risposta di CasaPound alle inutili polemiche nate a seguito dello striscione affisso dal movimento il 4 novembre davanti al Monumento ai Caduti di Marcianise. “Siamo venuti a conoscenza dalla stampa locale di inutili e fuorvianti considerazioni sul fascismo (che con la prima guerra mondiale non ha nulla a che vedere); considerazioni che ci hanno fatto tanto sorridere, essendo noi consapevoli del fatto che qualcuno non abbia nulla a cui pensare, e questa per loro sia stata una ghiotta occasione di ricerca di ridicola visibilità.

Il loro estremo sacrificio non sarà mai dimenticato e i loro nomi riecheggiano nel “PRESENTE” che abbiamo gridato stasera e che grideremo sempre più forte ogni volta che ci sarà qualcuno che proverà a sminuire o infangare questa data. Al termine della commemorazione come sempre ci siamo recati anche al cimitero austro-ungarico a rendere omaggio a quei soldati un tempo nemici, ma che hanno semplicemente difeso anch’essi la loro patria con onore e per questo meritano il nostro rispetto.",2024-11-07 11:36:52+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/42407,,,665,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ci siamo sentiti in dovere di farlo perché da anni centro-sinistra e centro-destra hanno abbandonato intere zone di Bologna al controllo di delinquenti e spacciatori, con piazze diventate terra di nessuno e autorità che girano le spalle o, peggio, condannano le iniziative spontanee di presidio del territorio, denominandole “ronde fasciste” La sinistra, al governo della città ormai da decenni, foraggia e incoraggia colpevolmente l’immigrazione di massa ed è indifferente alle legittime aspettative di serenità e legalità degli Italiani. È tempo di reagire. Per questo motivo, questo sabato 9 novembre saremo in piazza a Bologna, tutti uniti sotto la bandiera del tricolore. Per difendere le nostre città, per riprenderci i nostri quartieri, a Bologna come in tutta Italia.

C’est la persécution, orchestrée par la République contre les prêtres et les catholiques, qui décide ce simple paysan à s’engager du côté des rebelles. A la tête de partisans courageux et disciplinés, le général Cadoudal fait preuve de vaillance et d’une grande intelligence. Après des affrontements incessants et épuisants, Cadoudal refuse pourtant de se ranger aux côtés de Napoléon lorsque ce dernier est nommé 1er consul. Il s’en méfie. C’est le début d’une longue chasse à l’homme. Cadoudal reste d’abord insaisissable, mais de plus en plus isolé, il est arrêté et guillotiné le 25 juin 1804 au cri de « Vive le Roi ».

The subject is simply whatever in design or architecture happens to take his fancy. It might be the splendid reopening of the magnificent Midland Grand Hotel at St Pancras Station, or the dilapidation of a little-known church in Eastbourne; the much-lamented demise of the original Routemaster bus, or the colossal majesty of the airship sheds that housed the R.101. But while these pieces display a wonderful range and variety, they are unified by Stamp’s wider quest: to explore, define and champion the very Englishness of English architecture and design. When fine examples are preserved and restored, he celebrates; when they fall victim to philistine neglect – or, worse, demolition – he mourns. And when the elegant is overshadowed by the merely modish, he deplores. In Anti-Ugly, Stamp has selected the best of these ‘excursions’, producing a compulsively readable collection that builds into an eloquent, learned, trenchant and often indignant portrait of our national design heritage.",2024-11-06 06:19:36+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/42313,,,801,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Le sonorità minimali, spesso acustiche, si intrecciano con atmosfere scure e nostalgiche. Ma qui l’approccio del gruppo si evolve: ogni brano è una lenta marcia rituale che si trasforma in tributo alla resistenza e al coraggio. Le sonorità quasi sacrali risuonano in una veste musicale intensa e ipnotica, caratterizzata da un uso sapiente delle chitarre acustiche, da toni cupi e da melodie che evocano il misticismo, quasi fosse una litania che celebra ombre e spiriti dimenticati.[...]"" Un'altra bellissima recensione di Cesare Buttaboni per versacrum.com",2024-11-05 17:37:41+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/42295,,,793,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.1509.user.Zentropa451.post.42245,1187228866,Zentropa451,42245,,"🇬🇧 Lukovmarch is a symbol of the memory that Bulgarian nationalists preserve for General Hristo Lukov, who was murdered by red terrorists. When Lukovmarch began 21 years ago, the memory of the General was almost extinguished, but today—after long and persistent efforts—it has been revived with new strength and lives on in the hearts of young patriots and many other European nationalists. For us, Lukovmarch is a matter of duty. It symbolizes resistance against the oppression of the current political system. But Lukovmarch is not only a symbol for Bulgaria and Bulgarian nationalists; over the years, it has stood alongside other major nationalist events in Europe, such as the ""Day of Honor"" in Hungary, Acca Larenzia in Italy, the March of Independence in Poland, and the commemoration of the bombings of Dresden, thus expressing a pan-European struggle for independence and patriotic memory. Lukovmarch unites us. It unites us—Bulgarian nationalists—and it unites all European nationalists who come to Sofia in February to honor the memory of General Lukov together with us.

Già negli anni precedenti l’amministrazione comunale si era distinta per aver organizzato cortei antifascisti, in risposta alla commemorazione di Zilli, senza rispetto alcuno per la sua memoria. Al contrario di quanto temono certi personaggi, in 20 anni di cortei in ricordo di Emanuele, non abbiamo mai dato adito a critiche, lamentele, sproloqui o vaneggiamenti.

Quelle est dans sa germination la part de l'hérédité et la part de l'environnement ? Cette interrogation hante l'Europe triomphante. Elle divise les moralistes de l'Âge classique et les encyclopédistes des Temps modernes. Tout comme les théologiens de l'Église et les philosophes de l'Académie.

Attentäter sprengt sich beim Anschlag selbst in die Luft, seine Komplizin wird schwer verletzt An diesem Wochenende fanden in Athen verschiedene Gedenkveranstaltungen statt, mit denen an die Ermordung von der beiden Patrioten Giorgos Fountoulis († 27) und Manolis Kapelonis († 22) erinnert wurde, die im September 2013 von einem bis heute nicht ermittelten Linksextremisten vor dem Büro der nationalistischen Partei „Golden Dawn“ (Goldene Morgenröte)“ erschossen wurden. Überschattet wurde das diesjährige Gedenken durch einen Bombenanschlag, der sich am Donnerstag (31. Oktober) ereignete: Zwei Linksextremisten hatten versucht, einen Sprengsatz am Ort der Gedenkveranstaltung zu deponieren, um ihn mutmaßlich während des Gedenkens zu zünden, offenbar gab es jedoch eine Fehlzündung und die Bombe explodierte in Anwesenheit der beiden Antifaschisten. Ein Linksextremist, laut szeneinternen Veröffentlichungen soll es sich um den 36-jährigen Kyriakos X. handeln, wurde dabei direkt Richtung Himmel befördert und starb noch vor Ort, seine Begleiterin, es soll sich um die 33-jährige Marianna M. handeln, kam schwer verletzt in ein Krankenhaus. Die griechische Polizei ermittelt gegen Marianna M., sowie mutmaßliche Mittäter, die noch unbekannt sind, wegen Bildung einer terroristischen Organisation. Zuerst berichtete der Telegram-Kanal „Sturmzeichen“ über den Anschlag. Beide Täter beteiligten sich an Besetzung von griechischem Konsulat in Berlin Die internationale Dimension dieses Terroraktes wird jedoch erst langsam deutlich. Der Twitteraccount „Nordkiez75“, der von verschiedenen Antifa-Strömungen aus Berlin-Friedrichshain betrieben wird und der Hausbesetzerszene in der Rigaer Straße nahesteht, berichtet nämlich nicht nur ausführlich über den Anschlag, sondern teilt auch exklusiv mit, dass Kyriakos und Marianna im Jahr 2021 an der Besetzung des griechischen Konsulats in Berlin beteiligt gewesen sind. Es ist davon auszugehen, dass die Täter nicht lediglich für eine Konsulatsbesetzung nach Deutschland gereist sind, sondern engste Verbindungen in die Berliner Antifaszene haben oder sogar tragender Teil von ihr sind. Dies zu ermitteln wäre jetzt die Aufgabe von BKA & Co, entsprechende parlamentarische Anfragen im Bundestag könnten den notwendigen Druck aufbauen. Versteckt sich der untergetauchte Top-Terrorist Johann Guntermann in Athen? Dass es seit langem enge Verbindungen zwischen der deutschen Antifa-Szene und ihren Genossen in Athen, speziell im Stadtteil Exarchia, gibt, ist kein Geheimnis. Schon unmittelbar nach dem Untertauchen des Antifa-Top-Terroristen Johann Guntermann, der als Chef der berüchtigten Hammerbande agierte und der mittlerweile per Öffentlichkeitsfahndung gesucht wird, gab es Spekulationen über einen Aufenthalt in der autonomen Szene von Athen, die als europaweit stärkste ihrer Art gilt. Die nun aufgetauchten Verbindungen zwischen griechischen Antifa-Terroristen und der Berliner Antifa-Szene sollten Anlass genug sein, dieser Spur intensiv nachzugehen.

Il y a un consensus académique pour dire que le racisme antiblanc n’existe pas. Aucun travail savant sur le sujet, rien qu’un modeste recueil de témoignages colligés par Tarik Yildiz dans Le racisme antiblanc (2010), un fascicule d’une cinquantaine de pages. Que pèsent-elles face à l’avalanche d’articles et de livres qui nous expliquent que ce racisme est un objet sociologiquement douteux, illégitime, raciste ? Qu’il y a un seul racisme structurel, etc. Il y a des raisons inavouées à ce déni. La première d’entre elles, c’est que ces enseignants du supérieur viennent des beaux quartiers ou des quartiers gentrifiés. Ils n’ont pas fait leurs années de collège dans des écoles gangrenées par les enjeux raciaux. Leurs enfants non plus. Eux sont détenteurs du seul privilège qui compte : le privilège progressiste, parisien, métropolitain, avec un capital culturel épais comme le Who’s who et une bonne conscience haute comme la tour Eiffel. Il faut être fils d’un vice-recteur d’académie comme Edwy Plenel ou appartenir à la très haute bourgeoisie comme Clémentine Autain pour être à l’abri de ce racisme.

De manifestation éclatante de l’autorité royale légitime, il est devenu synonyme, depuis 1789, de captation illégale du pouvoir par un homme ou un groupe, agissant par surprise et plus ou moins violemment.

In the midst of a climate of terrorism once again and in the face of the new attempt by the state-parastate to prevent this year's commemoration from taking place (sending an entire motorcade to the monument), the nationalist guard stood up. We really wonder how accidental was the explosion and dismemberment of the comrade in Ampelokipi a day before November 1st. How coincidental that the anti-terrorist brought in specially trained dogs to check the cemetery and memorial grounds for explosives. How accidental was the silence of the once staunch anti-fascists?

La créolisation fait partie du baratin à la mode à l’heure de l’happy hour dans le 20e arrondissement et des pique-niques aux Buttes-Chaumont, le hype de la gentrification parisienne.

Mais ça, c’est la façade du village global Potemkine : derrière les sourires apprêtés et le décor en trompe-l’œil, très peu de diversité. Tout le monde la fuit secrètement. Les gens sont anti-mélangistes. Même Pap Ndiaye a mis ses enfants à l’École alsacienne.

L’âge et les origines les rapprochent : ils ont cinquante ans et viennent d’un milieu modeste et provincial. S’ils ont publié quelques livres, l’un et l’autre viennent d’écrire celui qui pourrait les lancer. Ils s’appellent Patrice Jean et Bruno Lafourcade. Ils sont proches et différents, l’un moins emporté que l’autre, mais l’amitié est immédiate, alimentée par des centaines de lettres, où se lit une admiration mutuelle, et une commune « poursuite de l’idéal ». Dans ce choix de lettres, ce roman vrai de la condition de l’écrivain moderne, se succèdent, avec une drôlerie désabusée ou vacharde, les anecdotes et les réflexions sur le milieu de l’édition, les mutations du livre, les mutations sociales. On les suit, poussé par un ton ironique ou détaché, drôle ou violent, chez Gallimard ou Léo Scheer, dans les librairies ou les salons du livre ; on assiste à leurs échecs et à leur espoir, à leur joie et à leurs succès. « Notre génération réussira à proposer une alternative à la génération 68 qui a voulu la tuer. Les baby-boomers ont intronisé des écrivains qui ne leur faisaient pas d’ombre ; mais nous, nous sommes de mauvais fils. »",2024-10-30 12:09:37+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/42009,,,848,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L’héroïsme n’est pas quelques secondes de combat valeureux, mais une vie de petits combats quotidiens pour rester droit dans les grands moments. Pour persévérer, il faut des routines, tout en variant si nécessaire. Rien de grand ne se fait rapidement, tout prend du temps, donc de la persévérance. Rome et la chrétienté ne se sont pas faites en un jour. Au soir de votre vie, préférez-vous ressembler à des adolescents vieillissants, ou à ces vieillards qui ont aimé la même femme et vu le sourire de leurs petits-enfants ?

Eh bien, il est sans doute temps de se jeter à l’eau avec tous les risques que cela comporte et de mettre sous les projecteurs les dix points-clés d’un programme cohérent et synthétique, d’une feuille de route, d’un manifeste, qui reconsidérera de fond en comble et sans tabou la démocrature occidentale, lui préférant une ethnocratie où le peuple de la nation serait à nouveau souverain et fier de son identité. Une affiche en dix points qui refondrait intégralement l’organisation territoriale et administrative, présenterait une vision géopolitique euro-continentale et un projet économique ouvertement protectionniste, rejetant le casino planétaire et son insupportable tendance à broyer les classes populaires.

Les pastilles de l’info aborderont : 1) Mort de Yahya Sinouar : le deux poids deux mesures ? 2) ""Violences routières"" : la récupération permise ? 3) Non à l’UE en Moldavie : attaque contre la démocratie ? 4) Le livre de Jordan Bardella et la censure de l’extrême gauche 5) Des Nord-Coréens dans l’armée russe ? Pour conclure, le portrait piquant du jour en partenariat avec l’OJIM sera consacré à Yves Calvi, un journaliste avec un gros appétit médiatique !

Un mandat oblige un élu. C’est peut-être un peu vieux jeu ou démago’ de le rappeler, mais si. Un poste de député, c’est la traduction de la confiance accordée par les électeurs – les administrés – et il oblige à une certaine tenue, une certaine éthique, une certaine exemplarité. Mes amis du village, aux jeunes sapeurs pompiers, “pissaient” tous les trois mois : ils avaient un contrôle anti-drogues pour que l’institution s’assure de leur lucidité en cas d’intervention. Raisonnable, personne ne serait rassuré si les pompiers étaient dans un état second. Maintenant, dans le cas d’Andy Kerbrat, il n’est pas question d’un boulot de pompier : ce n’est ni plus ni moins qu’un législateur, un gouvernant, un mandaté, en bref, quelqu’un qui touche à des dossiers de pouvoir et qui par conséquent, occupe un “poste stratégique”. Poste stratégique qui exige de lui une lucidité absolue. 👉🏻 Mais qu’on s’entende : Kerbrat n’est coupable que d’avoir été le malchanceux à se faire attraper. Pour avoir traîné un peu à l’Assemblée – et globalement, dans des milieux institutionnels – entre mai 2022 et septembre 2024, je peux vous assurer que la décomplexion de la classe politique, toutes couleurs politiques confondues, vis-à-vis des mœurs et notamment des drogues est absolue. 🔥 Ce sentiment d'impunité doit prendre fin. Il faut pousser pour demander une démission d’Andy Kerbrat et ouvrir le débat de la moralité dans la vie publique, quitte à envisager, pourquoi pas, la revendication de mise en place de tests de dépistage pour les députés.",2024-10-24 12:26:23+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/41815,,,740,0,2,1,PeerChannel,1894469348.0,raphaelayma,2024-10-24 12:16:46,2024-10-24,https://t.me/raphaelayma/99,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.1957.user.Zentropa451.post.41796,1187228866,Zentropa451,41796,,""" La littérature antique nous a familiarisés, dès Hésiode, avec l’idée d’un âge d’or suivi de périodes de plus en plus sombres, d’argent, de bronze et de fer. Ce même mythe apparaît, avec quelques variations, dans la grande épopée indienne du Mahâbhârata quelques siècles plus tard. Mais à la différence de la Grèce, l’Inde propose, dès le début, une estimation chiffrée de la durée de ces âges, inscrits dans un processus cyclique d’une grande complexité. Dès lors, le mythe des quatre âges devient la pierre angulaire de la religion commune. Naît alors une nouvelle conception du temps, débouchant sur une eschatologie : nous allons droit vers une catastrophe qu’annoncent la crise écologique, un inéluctable désintérêt du spirituel, l’érosion des religions, la désagrégation des familles et le relâchement des mœurs. Cependant, le kali-yuga, « l’âge des conflits », offre, des compensations inattendues. C’est si vrai que certains sages des âges antérieurs ont, selon les textes, regretté d’être « nés trop tôt ». C’est un aspect méconnu de la doctrine des quatre âges, qui prend un relief singulier à notre époque et que tente d’explorer le présent ouvrage, à partir d’une lecture attentive des inépuisables sources de la tradition hindoue.

I am a European by ancestry, but birth isn’t enough on its own, if one doesn’t possess the consciousness of being what one is. I exist only through roots, through a tradition, a history, a territory. I will add that I was destined to dedicate myself to arms. Certainly, there is a trace of that in the steel in my pen, the instrument of my profession of writer and historian.

Péter Veres, le président de l'union des écrivains hongrois, lut un manifeste à la foule, les étudiants firent de même et la foule commença à chanter le poème patriotique interdit, Nemzeti dal, dont le refrain était « nous le jurons, nous le jurons, que nous ne serons esclaves plus longtemps ! ». Quelqu'un dans la foule découpa les armoiries communistes du drapeau laissant un trou distinctif et d'autres firent de même. Ensuite, la foule traversa le Danube pour rejoindre les manifestants devant le bâtiment du Parlement hongrois. Vers 18 h, plus de 200 000 personnes étaient présentes; la manifestation était exubérante mais pacifique. À 20 h, le premier secrétaire Ernő Gerő diffusa un discours condamnant les demandes des écrivains et des étudiants. Vers 21 h les premiers coups de feu éclatent, un jeune homme de 18 ans tombe, Janos Vizi. Énervés par la ligne dure de Gerő, certains manifestants décidèrent d'appliquer l'une de leurs demandes, le retrait d'une statue en bronze de Staline de 10 m de haut qui fut érigée en 1951 sur le site d'une église qui avait été démolie pour lui faire de la place. La statue fut renversée à 21 h 30 et la foule en liesse plaça le drapeau hongrois dans les bottes de Staline qui étaient tout ce qui restait de la statue. À peu près au même moment, une large foule se rassembla devant le bâtiment de Radio Budapest qui était lourdement gardée par l'ÁVH. Le moment critique eut lieu lorsqu’une délégation voulant diffuser ses demandes fut arrêtée et que la foule s'agita après des rumeurs faisant état de manifestants abattus. Valéria Benke, la directrice de la radio, donne un micro mais c'est un stratagème, rien n'est radiodiffusé. Des gaz lacrymogènes furent lancés depuis le bâtiment et l'ÁVH ouvrit le feu sur la foule, faisant plusieurs morts. L'ÁVH tenta de se réapprovisionner en cachant des armes dans une ambulance mais la foule repéra la ruse et l'intercepta. Les soldats hongrois envoyés en soutien de l'ÁVH hésitèrent un moment avant d'arracher leurs insignes et de rejoindre la foule. Provoqués par les attaques de l'ÁVH, les protestataires réagirent violemment. Les voitures de police furent incendiées, les dépôts d'armes furent pris d'assaut, les armes furent distribuées à la foule et les symboles du régime communiste furent vandalisés.",2024-10-22 23:34:16+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/41734,,,792,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Great Napoleon for Children by J. de Marthold 55 pages, 11″x8.5″ Released by Little Frog Hill, an imprint of Antelope Hill Publishing. — Originally published in 1893, The Great Napoleon for Children is a gripping, colorful account of the life of one of the brightest minds in military history. The original ornate illustrations of the magnificent Napoleon Bonaparte spill across nearly fifty pages, covering the events from his birth in 1769 to his death at St. Helena in 1821, and featuring his many explosive feats in between, including the mobilization of tens of thousands of men, grand and exotic thousand-mile journeys, the painful loss of friends and comrades, and even dogs trained to salute their emperor. Even hundreds of years after his death, the world salutes Napoleon and his monumental achievements. More than just a cozy bedtime story, The Great Napoleon for Children is a snapshot of history which attests to the reasons for Napoleon’s near-mythic legacy. The highlight reel of his achievements and tribulations presented by the book provide an excellent jumping-off point for your little ones to learn about the life and times of a man who defined an era. This new English translation of a French-language classic should entice both parents and children alike.

Or, les invasions successives ont conduit ces trois peuples à se confondre progressivement dans ce qui deviendra la France : César envahit la Gaule au Ier siècle avant J.-C., tandis que les invasions germaniques débutent au Ve siècle après J.-C. Ces invasions et le peuplement de la Gaule qu’elles impliquent marquent profondément la langue française, d’origine latine avec un substrat gaulois et un superstrat germanique. Il est vraisemblable que les mentalités, elles aussi, résultent de la fusion progressive de ces trois peuples, ce qui amène à s’interroger sur la perception médiévale de la forêt : est-elle le lieu de tous les dangers, comme pour les soldats romains ? Ou est-elle un lieu sacré qui offre une protection bienvenue ? Comment les textes médiévaux décrivent-ils la forêt ? »",2024-10-18 16:26:10+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/41605,,,1021,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L'épée est certes un outil fonctionnel, une prouesse technique et un objet d’art, mais aussi un artefact animé qui, dégageant une force surnaturelle, rend le chevalier invincible. Le combattant, le forgeron et les fées aimantes transmettant leurs épées sont au cœur de ce livre, qui explore les mentalités d’une époque révolue dont les récits continuent d’inspirer de nos jours l’heroic fantasy. L’épée est aussi le signe de la prépondérance sociale du chevalier et le symbole de la guerre dont il se réserve en exclusif l’exercice.

È un rito antico che si rinnova ogni anno, un lavoro paziente che trasforma i frutti della natura in uno degli elementi più preziosi della nostra alimentazione. L’olio d’oliva, con il suo colore dorato e il sapore inconfondibile, è molto più di un semplice condimento: è la nostra storia, la nostra cultura, il nostro patrimonio. Gli antichi Romani lo consideravano un dono prezioso, utilizzandolo non solo come alimento, ma anche come medicina e unguento per il corpo. Era simbolo di ricchezza e salute, un bene così importante da essere chiamato “l’oro liquido”. Ancora oggi, quell’eredità continua a vivere sulle nostre tavole, portando con sé tradizioni e sapori che non abbiamo mai dimenticato. Invitiamo tutti a partecipare con noi alla raccolta delle olive, per riscoprire insieme il valore di questo gesto antico. Un momento di condivisione e lavoro all’aria aperta che ci avvicina alla terra e ci regala un prodotto genuino, frutto della nostra dedizione e del nostro amore per le tradizioni. Unisciti a noi e vivi l’esperienza della raccolta: insieme possiamo trasformare il lavoro delle nostre mani in oro puro.

msg_iteration.2220.user.Zentropa451.post.41531,1187228866,Zentropa451,41531,,""" Odin, le grand dieu scandinave, crée le monde en l’extrayant du chaos; Thor, son fils, le défend contre les géants. Si Thor est très populaire, Odin inquiète : il connaît le destin des dieux, leur inévitable « crépuscule » – car ces divinités, conçues à l’image des hommes, sont aussi mortelles. Ce livre relate leurs aventures, leurs amours, leurs combats et leurs coups pendables. Tout un panthéon les accompagne, de l’ambivalent Loki à la sensuelle Freyja, du sanglier Sæhrímnir à l’arbre Yggdrasill, du géant Ymir au rayonnant Baldr… En leur compagnie, le lecteur part à l’aventure dans un monde de feu et de glace ou l’on retrouve nos très vieux questionnements sur la vie et la mort. Le combat perdu d’Odin et de Thor contre les forces du chaos, le Ragnarok, ne signe en rien leur disparition. Mis à toutes les sauces, de Game of Thrones aux Marvel Comics, ces super-héros, bien éloignés de la civilisation qui les a vus naître, façonnent aujourd’hui l’imaginaire occidental. Aussi cette mise au point, érudite et amoureuse, est-elle indispensable pour mieux comprendre et apprécier ce panthéon nordique, complexe mais terriblement humain.""",2024-10-17 08:10:40+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/41531,,,850,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.2223.user.Zentropa451.post.41528,1187228866,Zentropa451,41528,,"NEW FROM ARKTOS Dominique Venner — Ernst Jünger: A Different European Destiny In Ernst Jünger: A Different European Destiny, Dominique Venner offers a captivating biography and a profound analysis of one of Europe’s most enigmatic right-wing thinkers and writers. Ernst Jünger, the decorated soldier, philosopher, and literary giant, lived through and reflected upon some of the most defining moments of the 20th century, from the trenches of World War One and occupied Paris in World War Two to the intellectual upheavals of postwar Europe. His works, imbued with themes of heroism, discipline, and existential challenge, resonate with those who seek to overcome the limitations of a degenerate modernity. Venner explores not only Jünger’s extraordinary life but also the philosophical underpinnings of his most celebrated writings. Through this dual approach, Venner sheds light on Jünger’s unique worldview — one shaped by war, myth, and a search for meaning in a world increasingly marked by technology and conformity.

Après un procès expéditif entamé le 14 octobre, la Reine Marie-Antoinette est condamnée à mort pour haute trahison et exécutée place de la Révolution. Trois chefs d'accusation ont été retenus : – avoir épuisé le trésor national; – avoir entretenu des intelligences et des correspondances avec l'ennemi; – avoir tramé des conspirations contre la sûreté intérieure et extérieure de l'Etat C'est avec courage et dignité qu'elle monte sur l'échafaud, laissant derrière elle son fils et sa fille. Emprisonnée depuis l'été 1792, elle meurt moins d'un an après l'exécution de son époux, le Roi Louis XVI. Jusqu'au bout, elle fait preuve d'un courage exemplaire. Elle refuse de se confesser à l'abbé constitutionnel Girard. Et quand ce dernier, l'invite au courage, elle répond : ""Du courage ! Ah ! Monsieur, il y a plusieurs années que j'en fais l'apprentissage. Ce n'est pas au moment que mes maux vont finir qu'on m'en verra manquer. "" Lorsqu'elle arrive sur la plate-forme de l'échafaud, par mégarde son pied heurte celui du bourreau Sanson. "" Monsieur je vous demande excuse, je ne l'ai pas fait exprès.

Auguro buona lettura agli amici italiani, auguro buona lettura sopratutto a chi a chi non concorda con le mie idee, auguro buona lettura, spero, a chi è riuscito a disfarsi dell’immancabile emiplegia invalidante. D’altronde, come ebbi modo di esprimere in un’intervista, «avendo sempre considerato infermi gli uomini di destra che non hanno una cultura di sinistra e gli uomini di sinistra che non hanno una cultura di destra (il che fa ritenere, non fatico a riconoscerlo, a problemi, che esista una grande maggioranza di infermi), il mio gusto mi porta in effetti verso gli autori meno emiplegici: quelli che hanno saputo sostenere nel contempo, o in sequenza, posizioni “di sinistra” e “di destra”, oppure gli autori di sinistra che hanno esercitato un’influenza a destra (o viceversa)».

Roma sincronizza la sua sacralità in un atto di purezza. Un'acqua sorgiva, priva d'impurità, è un'acqua che riordina. Per chi la raccoglie col giusto animo, essa consente una pulizia profonda dei propri ambienti, per chi partecipa al Rito, permette di lavare via le scorie interiori, gli scarti dell'esteriorità. Lo scroscio dell'acqua è d'ausilio, come un mantra, aiuta a spezzare il flusso dei pensieri. Ricollegarsi all'archetipo è l'obiettivo. Ciò che sgorga così puro è il manifestarsi di un principio eterno, Potenza che si fa Forza, immagine che si fa Realtà.

Le bleu est la couleur de la France, le choix de cette couleur est dû à ce vulgaire cochon domestique qui, vagabondant dans une rue de Paris, causa cet accident. Cette mort provoquée par un animal impur, apparut aux contemporains comme une souillure infâme jetée sur la monarchie et sur le royaume. Pour l'effacer, ce dernier fut placé sous la protection de la Vierge, à laquelle on emprunta deux de ses attributs iconographiques pour créer les premières armoiries royales : le lis et l'azur, symboles de pureté.

Les vestiges de sa grandeur passée, sa beauté à la fois immuable et dégradée, son altière décadence sont le décor parfait du romantisme blessé. Une ville désormais peuplée de teufeurs, de hipsters et d'un lumpen prolétariat totalement acculturé mais dont les pierres respirent encore l'art et la littérature, la violence historique et la volonté impériale. Un écrin aujourd'hui vide mais toujours enivrant. Il suffit de marcher au hasard, exposé à toutes les embuscades de beauté et de poésie, et de garder constamment le regard au niveau du premier étage des maisons et immeubles, juste au dessus de la zone où commencent le grouillement et le pourrissement. Ne rien écouter, surtout, ni les palabres des passants, ni les vociférations des obsédés téléphoniques, juste ressentir. Oublier les remugles de pisse se dégageant du clodo vautré sur le trottoir, les vociférations des camés du cellulaire, les éructations des racailles en goguette, la triste passivité des bouches de métro dégueulant leur diarrhée quotidienne de post-humains zombifiés. S’imaginer à une autre époque, en un autre temps, dans les pages d’un roman de Malet ou de Simenon, espérer croiser un mousquetaire ou un hussard au coin de la rue, inventer une barricade, une canonnade, s’évader pour pas cher… La magie de Paris survit à tous les outrages, et si l’on veut bien souvent quitter et fuir ce qu’elle est devenue, c’est en gardant toujours, quelque part au fond de l’âme et du coeur, l’espoir d’y revenir un jour.

Firenze – ormai da tempo – è stata svuotata della sua anima e ridotta a banale ""mangificio"" per i troppi turisti inconsapevoli che si aggirano tra le sue vie alla ricerca di un'esperienza standardizzata, identica a quella di tutte le città più gettonate del pianeta. Il centro storico, ormai abbandonato dai fiorentini e deturpato dalla centrifugazione selvaggia, è reso invivibile dalla criminalità diffusa e dalla mancanza di servizi essenziali. Ospiti nella nostra stessa città - relegati ai margini di uno scenario dove la cultura, la tradizione e l'identità locale vengono scientemente sacrificate sull'altare del profitto e del turismo di massa - assistiamo alla progressiva perdita di ogni riferimento specifico. La nostra non è solo una battaglia contro l'ennesimo franchising internazionale che si insedia tra le nostre strade, ma contro la visione che ha trasformato Firenze in un ""non-luogo"" senz'anima, dove il denaro conta più della comunità e l'apparenza prevale sull'essenza. Anche per questo, d’ora in avanti, è necessario operare un'azione di riappropriazione culturale, politica e fisica. La nostra città non è una vetrina globale, non è il parco giochi delle multinazionali, né il pascolo delle greggi lobotomizzate dai social, imboccate sul ""cosa fare in un giorno"". È un luogo con 2000 anni di vita, dove le relazioni internazionali si intrecciano con l’arte e l’artigianato; un patrimonio perenne di identità che stanno scomparendo nella voragine di un modello economico folle e predatorio. Rivendichiamo una Firenze dei fiorentini, vissuta e non (s)venduta, con un tessuto sociale sano, fatto di spazi comuni, di servizi, di sicurezza e di comunità; una città dove accogliere il turismo che rispetta e arricchisce, non quello che consuma e distrugge.",2024-10-12 09:23:38+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/41337,,,932,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mais cela n’a rien à voir avec la famille éclatée présentée dans le nouveau Hors-série de Valeurs actuelles : ""Les anars de droite"". Eric Letty, journaliste et collaborateur de Valeurs actuelles a regroupé 60 portraits d’artistes, d’écrivains qui ont tous eu comme traits communs d’être profondément attachés à la liberté et de refuser d’être des hommes-troupeaux ! Les anars de droite se sont faits, à tout risque, les défenseurs, parfois ultimes, de notre civilisation et de son identité. Infréquentables, irrespectueux, trublions ou romantiques, ils ont œuvré dans l’art, en plus de déplaire, de se faire détester. De Barbey d’Aurevilly à Jean Raspail, de Pierre Desproges à Gaspard Proust, de Céline à Sylvain Tesson, le hors série de Valeurs actuelles propose une truculente galerie de personnalités hors-normes maniant les idées anticonformistes et le panache de l’insolence. Des portraits passionnants d’une grande école, celle de la désinvolture. ATTENTION : Nous indiquons que pour évoquer Jean Raspail, TVL a choisi l'émission ""Perles de Culture"" animée par Anne Brassié.

Beim Abstieg vom Untersberg verunglückte unser Bergkamerad Andreas Münzhuber tödlich. Münzi, wie ihn alle nannten, war erst 37 Jahre alt und hatte im Leben noch viele Pläne. Sein Tod trifft uns alle hart. Seiner kleinen Tochter wollen wir ein Sparbuch einrichten, damit sie in Zukunft ein paar Sorgen weniger hat, wenn sie schon ohne Vater aufwachsen muß. Zur steten Erinnerung soll am Unglücksort einen Gedenkstein aufgestellt werden. Die ersten notwendigen Schritte für dieses Vorhaben haben wir schon eingeleitet. Darüber hinaus wollen wir die Kosten für die Beerdigung abfedern.

Aussi est-il devenu difficile pour beaucoup de se retrouver dans sa propre identité et sa propre culture quand on tente de choisir son vêtement sous les enseignes du marché français.

Après quoi on a inventé l’adolescence - qui s’est constamment allongée. C’est l’«adulescence». Elle a engendré un type dominant de notre époque: le narcissisme immature. Les hommes de droite sont de perpétuels adolescents, qui rêvent d’héroïsme et de chevaleries. Les hommes de gauche sont de perpétuels enfants, qui rêvent de fusion égalitaire et rassurante dans le giron maternel. L’allongement de l’immaturité est l’un des phénomènes actuels les plus frappants, constate Keith Howard, qui vient de publier Infantilised (Constable). « La nature veut que les enfants soient enfants avant que d’être hommes, écrivait Rousseau.

A l’ère d’internet, les Bretons perçoivent de nouveaux intersignes annonçant les décès ou révélant la présence des ""Anaon"", les ""âmes errantes"" qui hantent les chemins et les maisons. Perdues au fond des bois, des tombes immémoriales continuent de recevoir les offrandes de visiteurs anonymes ! Quel sens donner à ces phénomènes mystérieux, révélateurs d’un véritable culte des morts et d’une croyance dans l’autre monde ? Pourquoi dépose-t-on le cercueil du défunt à la croisée du transept dans l’église ? A quoi reconnait-on la présence de l’Anaon ? Qui sont les passeurs d’âmes ?

Chers lecteurs, Nous devons revenir sur notre événement Magnus / La Furia du 5 octobre. Un grand succès, mais qui a bien failli ne pas avoir lieu, puis virer à l’attentat. Pour cette rencontre signatures avec nos auteurs Dora Moutot, Marguerite Stern, Marsault, Laurent Obertone, Peno, Georges et Grégory Roose, nous avions d’abord réservé le bar L’Impasse, si bien nommé, dans Paris 11e, en versant un acompte. Les propriétaires, qui savaient qui nous étions depuis des semaines, ont attendu le dernier moment, la veille des signatures à 17 heures, pour invoquer des « raisons politiques » et nous décommander. Leur objectif était évidemment de nous priver de solution de secours, donc de vous priver d’événement. Soyons clairs : nous n’appelons à aucune mesure de rétorsion contre cet établissement – nos avocats s’en chargeront. Ce message a pour objet la stricte manifestation de la vérité, en l’occurrence de leur sournoiserie. Pas de chance pour eux, nos équipes ont aussitôt réagi et ont trouvé ce merveilleux plan B, en plein cœur de Paris, dans le 5e. Comme vous êtes les meilleurs, vous étiez des centaines, rien n’a pu vous arrêter, et nous vous en remercions. Ce changement d’adresse n’a pas empêché un regroupement d’antifas et/ou de transactivistes à République (manifestation non-déclarée), puis leur descente en force – et en armes – vers notre événement, descente qui s’est soldée grâce à l’efficacité de la BRAV-M par soixante-quatre interpellations aux abords de notre réunion, pour « participation à un groupement armé, détention d’armes et d’explosifs », faits passibles de cinq ans d’emprisonnement. Terrorisme légitimé par le complaisant silence de certains politiques, médias et collectifs habituellement plus bavards, par exemple la municipalité d’Anne Hidalgo, dont les équipes ont grandement contribué à la cabale hystérique contre le livre Transmania. Rien n’est plus motivant que cette pathétique adversité. Comptez sur nous pour ne rien céder, revenir plus vite et taper plus fort, ici et ailleurs. Nous comptons sur vous pour soutenir Dora et Marguerite, femmes les plus calomniées et menacées de France, véritables leçons de courage qui ont su mieux que personne exposer la dangerosité dogmatique du transactivisme, et qui mettent leur santé et leur vie en jeu pour ça. Vous savez maintenant exactement ce qu’il en est. Merci à tous. L'équipe Magnus / La Furia.",2024-10-07 19:23:45+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/41192,,,920,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A proporre la legge sono quelli che per decenni hanno falcidiato il mondo del lavoro, impoverendolo e precarizzandolo: l’Unione Europea, i partiti che si sono prestati a mettere in pratica queste politiche, il grande sindacato tradizionale, Confindustria e Banca d’Italia. Davvero si pensa di poter porre rimedio a trent’anni di attacchi al lavoro con un colpo di bacchetta magica? In questo libro Savino Balzano, forte della sua esperienza di sindacalista, mette in luce come lo strumento del salario minimo legale non abbia alcuna possibilità di risolvere i problemi radicali e profondissimi che hanno causato il crollo dei salari in Italia. Anzi, tutto induce a ritenere che una legge potrebbe provocare effetti persino controproducenti, livellando verso il basso le retribuzioni di coloro i quali oggi sono sopra la soglia minima prevista. 📍Libropolis, 11, 12, 13 ottobre, Pietrasanta 📚Programma completo: https://www.libropolis.org/ #",2024-10-07 09:30:57+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/41147,,,773,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Enregistré au fil d’une amitié de quinze ans, ce document nous transporte des débuts cinématographiques de Pasolini avec Accattone (1961) jusqu’à son Salò ou les 120 journées de Sodome (1975). Structurées autour de trois thèmes majeurs — Polémique, Politique et Pouvoir — ces conversations dévoilent les fondements de l’oeuvre de Pasolini. Elles abordent des sujets aussi variés que l’art, la société, la religion, le langage, la poésie et le cinéma, offrant une vision claire et percutante de ses idées. Les échanges entre Pasolini et Bachmann sont vifs, parfois amers, toujours fascinants, dépeignant une époque de bouleversements sociaux et culturels. Ces paroles résonnent encore aujourd’hui, apportant une réflexion profonde sur notre société contemporaine.

Carolus Magnus, roi des Francs, puis de Lombardie, apporte à Rome et aux États Pontificaux la protection de son armée pour respecter le serment de son père Pépin le Bref, fondateur de la dynastie Carolingienne. Ainsi légitimé Empereur d’Occident, digne héritier de son grand-père Charles Martel, il rétablit une dignité disparue à la chute de l’Empire romain plusieurs siècles auparavant. Guerrier redoutable, il fut également un protecteur des arts et des lettres, et donna à l’Europe ses dimensions et son architecture quasi-définitive. 🔴 Les inscriptions au prochain cycle général (2025/2026) sont ouvertes tout au long de l'année.

Il faut trouver l'équilibre entre la saine célébration des joies terrestres, voulues par Dieu, et la boursouflure de l’humain qui devient animal parce qu’il se gave sans plaisir des choses qu’il accumule en étant incapable d’en apprécier la valeur.

On le comprend bien : si les hommes réagissent à toutes sortes de stimuli qui ne coûtent rien (de la police de caractère utilisée pour écrire un texte à la couleur du papier), pourquoi ne pas utiliser ces biais pour vendre davantage et extraire davantage d’argent des consommateurs ? Parmi cent autres, Daniel Kahneman cite deux exemples intéressants. Le premier est celui d’une machine à café en libre-service, pour laquelle les consommateurs peuvent contribuer au montant de leur choix lorsqu’ils se servent. Lorsqu’une affiche représentant des yeux est placée au-dessus de la cafetière, les consommateurs contribuent jusqu’à cinq fois plus que lorsque l’affiche représente un bouquet de fleurs ! Le second exemple est celui des promotions permanentes. Essayer d’acheter un matelas, ou de l’électro-ménager (ou tout autre bien dont l’achat est relativement infréquent). Il y a de bonnes chances qu’il soit en promotion. Heureux de cette promotion, vous dépensez plus que vous n’aviez anticipé.

Non più funzionale alla formazione di ubbidienti consumatori e di schiavi delle nuove tecnologie, la cultura classica è trascurata o data in pasto ai deliri della cancel culture. Per questo, occorre recuperare la lunga tradizione del primato dei Classici, riscoprire i loro valori e continuare a tramandarli, senza smarrire le nostre radici. Perché nella poesia e nella storia, come nella filosofia greca e romana, scopriamo gli antidoti alle nuove tirannidi del presente e gli strumenti autentici per formare uomini e cittadini consapevoli. Questo saggio – che accompagna il lettore nell’universo dei Classici – offre anche una accurata traduzione dell’A Demonico di Isocrate, scrigno dei valori educativi degli antichi. Soltanto salvando il seme del passato – infatti – possiamo assicurare un futuro solido ai nostri figli, in un’epoca che vive solo al presente. La luce dei riferimenti perenni continua ad illuminare l’umanità in ogni epoca buia, attraverso la saggezza, la virtù e l’anelito di bellezza che riscatta le nostre anime dalla provvisorietà della materia.

Entre érudition et enquête, Colette Beaune retrace la vie réelle et rêvée de ce Robin des Bois français. Un simple fait divers au début. Personne sinon un chroniqueur n'y a d'abord prêté attention. La mémoire de cet exploit, quasi absente des chroniques royales sous l'Ancien Régime, persiste en Beauvaisis où le Grand Ferré devient au fil du temps un personnage populaire. Pour écrire le récit de cette vie enfouie sous de multiples légendes, Colette Beaune a enquêté ; elle a retrouvé sa trace dans les archives de l'abbaye de Compiègne et suivi le fil de son histoire jusqu'au XIXe siècle. Dès les premières heures de la Révolution, Ferré sort de l'oubli. Michelet fait de sa geste légendaire l'acte de naissance de la nation. Désormais, les historiens la déclinent pour tous les combats patriotes.

S'ils n'ont pas toujours ajouté à sa notoriété, ils n'ont pu trahir sa mémoire tant la vie de l'écrivain est transparente : en témoignent les 7 000 lettres de sa correspondance. Nombre de ses biographes n'ont pas jugé nécessaire de le contextualiser, d'autres ne se sont intéressés qu'à son œuvre littéraire ou ont forgé son effigie de sauveur du patrimoine sans saisir l'homme et son environnement politique et culturel. Mérimée en réhabilitant le patrimoine national, incarne une mise en valeur de la civilisation européenne et de son rayonnement universel. Le mérite de cette biographie est de relier le génie d'un homme à l'exubérance de son époque. Jean-Paul Charbonneau, fidèle en cela à ses précédents ouvrages, s'intéresse à ces personnages suffisamment brillants pour briguer tous les honneurs, y compris « l'immortalité » de l'Académie française, mais assez prudents pour éviter de se brûler les ailes au contact du pouvoir. Ces hommes, méconnus dans leur discrète proximité avec les puissants, sont des témoins privilégiés de leur temps. Mérimée est de ceux-là. Lui, comblé d'honneur et intime de l'impératrice Eugénie, put et sut parler à l'oreille de l'empereur et accomplir auprès de lui et avec lui ses multiples tâches, entamées en 1830, de grand serviteur de l’État.",2024-10-03 09:27:14+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/40966,,,855,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Le parti peut inscrire tout ce qu’il veut sur son programme, finalement c’est le groupe qui paie pour imprimer les tracts, les affiches, les journaux, qui choisit aussi ou rejette les candidats du parti.

Attraverso la lente della teoria ciclica della storia di Oswald Spengler, il libro esplora la figura di un leader politico che si è distinto per i suoi richiami all’America profonda, all’identità nazionale e alla lotta contro il progressismo woke, polarizzando l’opinione pubblica e animando un fitto dibattito. Un’analisi fuori dagli schemi, dove il mistero lovecraftiano incontra la gloria barbarica di Robert E. Howard, per aprire una prospettiva unica e filosoficamente ricca sul nostro tempo, mescolando motivi biblici, immagini apocalittiche e paralleli storici. “Trumpismo Esoterico”, dunque, si pone come disamina accademica e artistica del fenomeno, elaborata in stile poetico, capace di offrire un’intrigante esplorazione dell’approccio non convenzionale di Trump alla leadership.

A la moindre occasion, elle continue donc à beugler « la police avec nous ! », exprimant ainsi un attachement irrationnel, une sorte de névrose engendrée par son prétendu goût pour « l’ordre », qu’elle confond avec un légitimisme inconditionnel et béat et une appétence fétichiste pour l’uniforme. Cette inclination est également sans doute le fruit de sa peur physique, légitime d’ailleurs, face à la délinquance et la criminalité et son espérance, intime et secrète, mais systématiquement déçue, qu’un jour ou l’autre « la police va nettoyer tout ça ».

Il 6 agosto 2021 scoppiò sul quotidiano “Le Monde” una bomba letteraria. Jérôme Dupuis vi pubblicò un articolo intitolato “Migliaia di fogli inediti: i tesori ritrovati di Louis-Ferdinand Céline”. Poco più di un anno prima, nel giugno 2020, i due eredi universali di Lucette Almansor (la vedova di Céline), l’avvocato François Gibault, autore peraltro della biografia di riferimento dello scrittore e Véronique Robert-Chovin, che aveva accompagnato Lucette negli ultimi anni della sua vita, vennero avvisati del fatto che un ex giornalista di “Libération”, Jean-Pierre Thibaudat, critico teatrale del quotidiano fino al 2006, desiderava incontrarli poiché era in possesso di alcuni inediti di Céline. In questo documentato studio della Société des Lecteurs de Céline, il professore Jacques Joset ricostruisce l’appassionante “giallo” del ritrovamento degli inediti di Céline, dal loro furto da parte dei Maquis francesi nell’estate del 1944 a Parigi alle vicissitudini successive e alla loro pubblicazione, per poi passare a una puntuale analisi dei testi e della loro datazione e discutendone la rilevanza nel contesto dell’opera céliniana.",2024-09-27 13:45:57+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/40743,,,801,0,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.3029.user.Zentropa451.post.40712,1187228866,Zentropa451,40712,,""" À l'instar du ninja et du samurai, le yakuza fait partie des figures imposées de la culture et de la société japonaise. Largement représenté dans la littérature et le cinéma, couvert de tatouages, phalange coupée, langage rude et violence soudaine, il fascine et interroge : comment cette structure archaïque et quasi-féodale peut-elle perdurer dans un Japon démocratique, industrialisé et technologique ? Pour comprendre et éviter le piège de l'essentialisation et du culturalisme, une comparaison avec d'autres pays, notamment la mafia née en Sicile, permet de dégager des éléments communs, mais aussi de mettre à jour la spécificité de la pègre japonaise : sa proximité avec l'extrême droite, dans l'idéologie comme dans l'action. S'appuyant sur un méticuleux travail de recherche et une analyse originale, Philippe Pelletier démontre ainsi comment les yakuza sont nés à un moment donné, en un lieu donné, en réponse à une demande politique qui interroge in fine sur deux éléments : la nature réelle de la démocratie japonaise et le rôle d'une figure tout aussi emblématique que le yakuza, celle de l'empereur.

Cette évolution a commencé à la fin de la deuxième guerre mondiale, et s'est développée dans les années 1970 en accumulant les sanctions contre les contrevenants. Création de l'esprit occidental avec toutes les influences qu'il reçu au cours de son histoire, un corpus d'idées s'est constitué. Ces développements ont eu et auront de lourdes conséquences sur les comportements des peuples européens et américains du nord. Il convient donc de faire une critique objective, de ces éléments constitutifs et à ses conséquences. L'auteur fait un inventaire critique de cette norme qui exploite le flou de la sémantique et l'absence de définition claire. Quelles ont été les réactions à son installation au cœur de la pensée européenne et ses conséquences. Il s'agit d'un renversement total des valeurs qui s'est imposé à nous.

Elphège Filiatrault, curé de Saint-Jude, une paroisse située près de Saint-Hyacinthe, fait flotter sur le toit de son presbytère un drapeau qui se veut représentatif de la nation canadienne-française (on dirait aujourd'hui québécoise): le Carillon. Filiatrault donne du Carillon la description suivante: «Champ bleu, orné de quatre fleurs de lis et traversé d'une croix blanche». En 1903, à Québec, un groupe de Jésuites et de laïcs adopte le Carillon comme drapeau mais en le modifiant. Au centre, on ajoute le Sacré-Coeur ceint d'une couronne d'épines, surmonté d'une croix et entouré d'une guirlande de feuilles d'érable.

Mais son apparente perfection a des revers. Dans une enquête inédite, une journaliste révèle la face cachée de l’archipel. La démocratie japonaise est-elle aussi solide qu’elle en a l’air ? Comment un Premier ministre – Shinzo Abe – a-t-il pu être assassiné en pleine rue dans un pays où la délinquance est si faible ? La liberté de la presse y est-elle vraiment respectée ? Par quel moyen l’école y fabrique-t-elle des enfants si parfaits ? Quel sort y réserve-t-on aux immigrés ou aux minorités sexuelles ? Que cache la folle industrie du manga ? Pour quelles raisons, au pays de l’enfant-roi, la dénatalité n’a-t-elle pu être enrayée ? Le cinéma japonais est-il celui que l’on voit en France ? Au fil de ses reportages et de son expérience personnelle, Karyn Nishimura-Poupée, journaliste correspondante au Japon, raconte les réussites éclatantes et les atouts d’une société japonaise singulière et révèle, derrière ce grand pouvoir d’attraction, de plus sombres réalités – sociétale, politique, judiciaire, médiatique, éducative.",2024-09-26 06:13:08+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/40672,,,893,0,1,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Le incursioni aeree degli inglesi e degli americani – spesso programmate con cura per terrorizzare la popolazione civile – hanno provocato devastazioni senza precedenti e decine di migliaia di vittime. Il presente volume – ricchissimo di dettagli tecnici e di dati storici – tratta il periodo compreso tra il settembre 1943 e l’aprile 1945, soffermandosi sulla guerra aerea scatenata dagli Alleati e sulle vittime di quel conflitto, che ebbe molte sfaccettature e che – ancora oggi – presenta aspetti non del tutto chiariti. Gli eventi descritti – in ogni caso – denotano una fase storica epocale per l’Italia, foriera di conseguenze che si riflettono sull’attuale status geopolitico della penisola.

À l'âge de quinze ans, parmi la poignée de livres se trouvant au domicile familial, il découvre avec grand intérêt une vieille édition de l'ouvrage Les Patriotes de 1837-1838 de Laurent-Olivier David, dans lequel figurent notamment des lettres écrites par Chevalier de Lorimier avant son exécution. « L'Histoire se révélait.

Eve Vaguerlant remonte dans ce livre à la source idéologique de ce tabou. Elle montre que, dès son origine, le féminisme issu des années 1970 n’a pas seulement eu pour vocation de libérer les femmes de l’emprise de leur père et de leur mari, mais de les éloigner de la maternité. Et y a parfaitement réussi : aujourd’hui en Europe, c’est une femme sur quatre qui restera sans enfants. Mais le féminisme moderne est allé plus loin en soutenant la négation de la différence des sexes, qui pousse à rejeter en priorité la première caractéristique du féminin, à savoir la possibilité de porter la vie. Aujourd’hui, en faisant du féminin un choix, un « ressenti », entièrement déconnecté de toute réalité biologique, les arrière-petites-filles de Mme de Beauvoir prônent une idéologie qui, à terme, niera purement et simplement la nature de l’homme et de la femme. En s’appuyant sur les écrits de nombreux intellectuels, Eve Vaguerlant alerte sur le risque pour le combat féministe, s’il continue à refuser de voir les femmes comme des mères potentielles, de perdre tout sens en ne soutenant plus les causes qui aideraient vraiment les femmes dans leur quotidien.",2024-09-24 09:22:37+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/40568,,,801,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Je me définirais comme traditionnaliste. J’aimerais voir une reprise de la religion catholique avec plus de respect et d’importance.

msg_iteration.3284.user.Zentropa451.post.40450,1187228866,Zentropa451,40450,,"Pourquoi le courageux et patriote lieutenant de vaisseau Hervé Legrand, héros de Dunkerque et réfugié à Londres en juin 1940 refuse-t-il de répondre à l’appel du 18 juin ? et demande-t-il, comme la majorité de ses camarades, à être rapatrié en France ? Pourquoi, conformément aux ordres de celui qu’il considère comme seul chef légitime, l’amiral Darlan, sera-t-il amené à repousser les assauts de la Marine anglaise et de leurs protégés gaullistes après Mers-El-Kébir, puis deux ans plus tard, des Américains débarquant au Maroc ? Pourquoi après l’assassinat de Darlan, le 24 décembre 1942, Legrand choisit-il de reprendre avec enthousiasme le combat contre l’Allemagne, mais sous les ordres du général Giraud, proconsul américain en Afrique du Nord française, et non au sein des modestes forces navales de la France Libre ? Pourquoi ces choix réitérés alors que les deux femmes de sa vie les lui reprocheront l’une et l’autre avec véhémence, et finiront par le quitter : son épouse s’engage dans la résistance bretonne, sa compagne de Casablanca, la belle Hannah, désespérée par le maintien des lois antisémites, immigrera clandestinement en Palestine pour y mettre au monde leur fils qu’elle attend en secret. Après seize années de silence, ce fils devenu adolescent découvre fortuitement l’identité de son géniteur et veut faire sa connaissance. Mais comment, après la Shoah, expliquer à un jeune Israélien de 16 ans que son père est resté, trente mois durant, fidèle à Vichy quand bien même il a commencé et terminé la guerre en héros de la lutte contre l’Allemagne ? Scrupuleusement conforme à l’Histoire, ce « Journal de bord du commandant Legrand » témoigne de l’extrême complexité d’une époque tragique qui, pendant 30 mois, vit des Français également patriotes, s’entretuer dans une véritable guerre civile.",2024-09-21 12:04:37+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/40450,,,964,0,4,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

C’est ce que montre ce récit, consacré au parcours de douze familles dont l’auteur est issu, et dont trois sont connues depuis le Moyen Âge. Une extrême diversité y règne : quatre sortes de noblesse, des militaires de tous grades, une dynastie de chapeliers, des boulangers, des meuniers, force paysans. À un pasteur protestant de choc répond un prêtre catholique béatifié après les massacres de Septembre. L’avocat de l’affaire Calas tend la main à une vedette de l’industrie du cachemire, et l’étonnant compositeur Erik Satie se moque de trois généraux bretons. Guidé par ces personnages, le lecteur combat avec Jeanne d’Arc à Patay, se cache après la révocation de l’édit de Nantes, passe la Bérézina sur un pont qui s’écroule, assiste impuissant à l’incendie du ministère des Finances en 1871, s’efforce d’arrêter les chars allemands de mai 1940… Malgré tous ces contrastes, les douze familles convergent et, à force de mésalliances, réussissent une synthèse. L’ancienne France était beaucoup moins cloisonnée qu’on ne croit. Mais une question se pose. Comment nos ancêtres ont-ils pu résister à la longue série de calamités qui s’est abattue sur eux ? Assurément, ils étaient de bonne fabrique.",2024-09-21 11:53:37+00:00,https://t.me/Zentropa451/40448,,,892,0,2,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
