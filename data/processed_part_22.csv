It will be substantially larger than Iran's strikes against Israel on April 13th, and will likely cause substantially more damage than April 13th as well. One could view Operation True Promise (Iran's strikes against Israel in April) as a ""dress rehearsal"" for a future greater strike against Israel, as a good amount of the projectiles Iran fired were intercepted by Israel and allied nations such as Jordan and Saudi Arabia, which likely gave Iran a greater picture of air defenses. It's difficult to make lofty and bold predictions, so we won't say anything in stone, but this is a likely course of events when Iran retaliates against Israel for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. The ball is currently in Iran's court, but once Iran retaliates - of course, depending on how bold and strong the retaliation is - Israel's reaction to such retaliation will determine whether or not this medium-intensity conflict between Israel and the Axis of Resistance escalates more than it already has.

This is incorrect. Both Ukrainians and Azawads are feeding the lie. The soldiers that look 'Ukrainian / White' are Tuareg, most likely Algerian, or exiled-Libyan descent. Lighter skin tones amongst Tuaregs are not uncommon. Multiple Wagner sources deny Ukrainian involvement on the ground, some have even denied Ukrainian intelligence involvement. The Azawad forces and Azawad media has also denied Ukrainian involvement. The French org. 'Little', an intelligence source / think tank that has been operating in the Sahel for over a decade, denies Ukrainian involvement too. The photo being circulated originates from 'KyivPost', who had previously faked Timur's presence in Syria. Notably, the photo is a still image from several videos that were recorded prior to the 10th of July, and then shared on multiple platforms on Azawad pages. The photo therefore is over two / three weeks old. 'KyivPost' made the claim that the photo was taken at the scene, which is therefore untrue. For comparison, the current Wagner offensive in the north began on 20th of July. There also exist numerous close-up shots of light-skin Tuareg individuals at the recent battle scene, who would otherwise look 'Ukrainian' from afar.",2024-07-29 16:18:45+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/12329,,,6165,0,34,0,,,,,,,1,12313.0,https://t.me/rnintel/12313,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.11149.user.rnintel.post.11751,1810182217,rnintel,11751,,"🛰 🇺🇸 🇨🇳 US prepares jamming devices targeting Russia, China satellites 🔶️ The US is about to deploy a new ground-based jammer designed to blunt Chinese or Russian satellites from transmitting information about US forces during a conflict, the Space Force disclosed. 🔶️ The Pentagon’s space service branch tested the system for the first time earlier this year at two different locations, with control of the system at a third. The devices aren’t meant to protect US satellites from Chinese or Russian jamming but “to responsibly counter adversary satellite communications capabilities that enable attacks,” the Space Force said in a statement to Bloomberg News. 🔶️ The Pentagon strives - on the rare occasions when it discusses such space capabilities - to distinguish its emerging satellite-jamming technology as purely defensive and narrowly focused. That’s as opposed to a nuclear weapon the US says Russia is developing that could create high-altitude electromagnetic pulses that would take out satellites and disrupt entire communications networks. 🔶️ The first 11 of 24 Remote Modular Terminal jammers will be deployed in several months, and all of them could be in place by Dec. 31 at undisclosed locations, according to the Space Force statement. The terminals “are small, transportable and low-cost satellite communications jammers that can be deployed in austere environments to protect” US forces, the Space Force’s Rapid Capabilities Office said in a posting online. 🔶️ The new terminals augment a much larger jamming weapon called the Counter Communications System that’s already deployed and a mid-sized one called Meadowlands “by providing the ability to have a proliferated, remotely controlled and relatively relocatable capability,” the Space Force said. The Meadowlands system has encountered technical challenges that have delayed its delivery until at least October, about two years later than planned. 🔶️ China has “hundreds and hundreds of satellites on orbit designed to find, fix, track, target and yes, potentially engage, US and allied forces across the Indo-Pacific,” General Stephen Whiting, head of US Space Command, said Wednesday at the annual Aspen Security Forum. “So we’ve got to understand that and know what it means for our forces.” https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2024-07-19/us-jamming-devices-russia-china-satellites-14536629.html",2024-07-21 14:59:26+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/11751,,,4406,0,37,1,PeerChannel,1458480018.0,CIG_telegram,2024-07-21 14:59:02,2024-07-21,https://t.me/CIG_telegram/50369,0,,,1,MessageMediaWebPage,1,https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2024-07-19/us-jamming-devices-russia-china-satellites-14536629.html,stripes.com,"US prepares jamming devices targeting Russia, China satellites",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Those among us with knowledge about Iran's missile program know that there exists an upgraded version of the Kheybar Shekan, namely the Kheybar Shekan-2, which is outfitted with a special cone tip. The Kheybar Shekan-2 is an hypersonic missile. So, it seems that Iran has not only given Yemen the blueprints and expertise to build the regular Kheybar Shekan, but its most advanced, hypersonic brother: the 'Kheybar Shekan-2', under the Yemeni name 'Hatem-2'. No Iranian hypersonic missiles were used in its attack on Israel, so the fact that they allow the Yemenis to possess such advanced equipment that even they themselves have not used, speaks volumes about how comitted Iran is to the Axis of Resistance and its allies. @Middle_East_Spectator",2024-06-26 19:35:59+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/10796,,,3359,0,26,1,PeerChannel,1626824086.0,Middle_East_Spectator,2024-06-26 19:35:40,2024-06-26,https://t.me/Middle_East_Spectator/7254,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The video was posted to Twitter by former Israeli politician Yinon Magal, a member of the far-right National Religious Party- crucial to Netanyahu's pre war government coalition. The soldier in the video states that over 100,000 IDF reservists currently occupying Gaza would refuse any order they considered a ""surrender"" from IDF Chief of Staff or the Defense Minister. In his words, any agreement handing control of the Gaza territory back over to either Hamas, the PLO, or the Palestinian Authority would be a surrender. The soldier directly threatens ""You wanted a military coup? So I'm telling you, we are reservists who cannot go home – we'll show you what surrender and victory are, and we'll show you how real Jews win."" After the video went viral among Israeli users on Twitter and Telegram, IDF Chief Herzl Halevi has attempted to quell any seditious activity within the army, but it is, in all likelihood, too late. Left wing Israeli newspapers have joined the international chorus of journalists documenting the IDF's shift to outright Jewish supremacy and a seemingly endless pattern of atrocities committed in the names of the victims of the October 7 invasion while nothing official has been done to prevent such abuses and radicalization, until the IDF Chief was personally threatened by this video. From the perspective of the Admin: With the recent greenlighting by the Biden regime alongside continued ferocious support from the vast majority of US politicians for the Rafah operation, more crimes such as the massacre at the UN refugee camp earlier yesterday will become common. The IDF and Jewish diaspora around the world, and especially in the United States, represented by figures on the ""right"" like Ben Shapiro and Gad Saad, believe that Hamas and Palestinians are the ""modern day Nazis"" and see no qualm with carrying out extermination. The IDF, emboldened by foreign support and lack of discipline by the ruling Israeli War Cabinet, seem to have no fear of repercussions in any form, as support for the war upon Israeli citizens remains strong despite worldwide condemnation. We will have to wait and see what the Biden regime does as it becomes increasingly clear in the summer that the leftist apparatus that ""won"" him 2020 has turned against him over his support for the genocide, and the polls remain stagnant with Trump and the GOP pulling ahead. If the war continues into late summer when American colleges get back in session, increasingly aggressive leftist organizing will undoubtedly force Biden's hand.",2024-05-27 05:37:25+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/9815,,,5104,0,65,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.13059.user.rnintel.post.9782,1810182217,rnintel,9782,,"— 🇮🇷 Iran's Presidential Election is in 34 days, here's what you need to know: The political scene in Iran is extremely complicated, but when simplified, it basically consists of two main flanks: Conservatives and Moderates. The Conservatives are politicians that fit squarely in the camp of the revolution. They stand 100% behind Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and they are generally considered more loyal to the revolution's original values. They put emphasis on keeping Iran an Islamic, strong and independent nation, with a foreign policy that could be dubbed 'Iran-first', trying not to rely on outside powers. Most politicians who belong in this camp opposed the 2015 Nuclear Deal with the US, for example. The Moderates, or sometimes called 'Reformists', take a more liberal approach to interpreting the values of the Islamic Revolution. They are still ostensibly in favour of the Islamic Republic and its ideals, but wish to modernize and reorganize the country in a way that they feel fits the current era. Most of them support less strict rules on Hijab, returning to negotiations with the United States, and neoliberal market economics. Some Moderate candidates are secretly anti-Islamic Republic, but hide behind their close relations with genuine pro-IR people to conceal their true views. They know they cannot voice their opposition publicly, because no one would vote for them, and they would get disqualified. Iran's last Moderate President, Hassan Rouhani (President from 2013-2021) caused a major decline in economic development. By forming the Nuclear Deal with the U.S. in 2015, he put the Iranian economy at the mercy of foreign powers and investments. Khamenei, who was against the Nuclear Deal from the start, warned that the United States would never keep their end of the agreement. In 2017, he was proven right, and the U.S. unilaterally pulled out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, despite Iran's compliance, which was backed up by the IAEA. Inflation in Iran skyrocketed, and the economy experienced its worst state in 45 years. All of this led to the Conservative President Ebrahim Raeesi winning a 72% landslide victory in the 2021 election. Turnout hit a record low, because reformists had lost faith in their candidates due to past failures to deliver on their election promises. As a result, the vast majority of those who voted were hardline IR supporters. If President Raeesi ran for office again in 2025, he would most likely have won a second term. But due to his unforeseen martyrdom, others will have to stand up. Until now, we don't know the candidates, but I fully expect the Conservatives to win another landslide victory, as the Reformist voter base has become idle, and I doubt they will put up any meaningful candidates, unless they decide to put forward Javad Zarif, Iran's Foreign Minister from 2013-2021, who enjoys considerable support among Moderates. Lastly, the dynamics of Iranian politics have changed quite a lot. Back in the 2000's and 2010's, if someone was anti-Islamic Republic, they would simply vote for a Reformist / Moderate candidate, to show their opposition to the regime. This was dangerous, because they actually had a way of changing the country's direction. Unlike what some people think, the President in Iran matters a lot. Now, the people who are anti-IR simply don't vote at all, or cast blank protest votes, because they say 'all Iranian politicians are the same'. This is extremely dumb, they are shooting themselves in the foot, because if they all united to vote for a Reformist they could shake the country up pretty bad. But it is good for the Islamic Republic and its supporters, so I am quite happy they reached this conclusion, that they excluded themselves from the democratic process. Conclusion: Anti-IR Iranians likely won't vote at all, a small number of them will vote for the Moderate candidate, but the Conservative candidate will likely win another landslide victory like Raeesi in 2021, due to overwhelming participation of the pro-IR and religious masses. @Middle_East_Spectator",2024-05-25 22:25:44+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/9782,,,4155,0,31,1,PeerChannel,1626824086.0,Middle_East_Spectator,2024-05-25 20:24:00,2024-05-25,https://t.me/Middle_East_Spectator/6731,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.13529.user.rnintel.post.9289,1810182217,rnintel,9289,,"🇷🇺🇺🇦 - As we have been predicting since last year, Russia will imminently launch an offensive into the north, most likely towards Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkov. The raids that have occurred in the last 24 hours are nothing more than probing attacks, meant to test the Ukrainian defenses in this sector. Given that these small Russian sabotage and reconnaissance squads have managed to capture some locations, it's not looking good for Ukraine in terms of defense. In our opinion, Russia will be targeting Kupiansk in order to seize that and continue momentum south towards Lyman. From there, Russia will target Slaviansk and/or Kramatorsk, coupled with the advances from the south after the fall of Avdiivka. Slaviansk will more than likely play out very similarly to the battles of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, with Russian forces opting for pincer maneuvers around the city to force the defenders into a hasty and embarrassing withdrawal, rather than direct combat inside the city. As our predictions on this impending Russian offensive have come true, be on the lookout for the Donetsk front, especially the Avdiivka and Marinka sector.

msg_iteration.13943.user.rnintel.post.8856,1810182217,rnintel,8856,,"— 🇮🇷/🇮🇱 ANALYSIS: The Israeli missiles that were found in Iraq Two Israeli missiles have been found in Iraq, one in Latifiyah and one in Aziziyah. Based on their exterior resemblance, they seem to be of the Blue Sparrow or Silver Sparrow missile type. The Sparrow is an Israeli medium-range air-launched ballistic missile, which is currently in use as a target missile in the IDF, meaning, it is used to simulate an aerial target for defense systems like the Arrow-3, and in most cases it does not carry an active payload. Additionally, the Sparrow is a two-stage missile, meaning it consists of two parts, a booster and a warhead. The warhead detaches from the booster before entry. In two-stage missiles, the warhead does not travel much further than its detached booster, and the detached booster should be found not far away from the warhead's impact site. However, as seen in the image above, even the closest booster that was found was located in Aziziyah, which is over 100km away from Iran. Based on where the missile booster landed, it is extremely unlikely that the warhead traveled more than a few kilometers into Iranian airspace, if it even entered at all, and if there even was an active payload. After all this, while also keeping in mind the lack of visual evidence, it is inconceivable that even a single missile actually struck targets in Esfahan. @Middle_East_Spectator",2024-04-19 15:32:37+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/8856,,,3070,0,25,1,PeerChannel,1626824086.0,Middle_East_Spectator,2024-04-19 11:24:38,2024-04-19,https://t.me/Middle_East_Spectator/6290,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In spite of what mainstream media is saying, Israel wants to escalate the war with Iran. Why? Netanyahu has lost all support since October 7th. He desperately needs to gain it back if he wants to stay in power. The left-leaning and anti-Likud Mossad and the generally left-leaning IDF have been against Netanyahu ever since the judicial reform attempts, and have openly criticized Netanyahu for these actions. The IDF deciding to carry out this airstrike on the Iranian Embassy was probably a highly controlled maneuver- the IDF struck this in an attempt to put Netanyahu on the chopping block, believing he would crumble upon Iran's response. This would make since, as after the strike the 2 commanders who ordered it were relieved of their command. There are two states within a state inside Israel; the deep state, which consists of the military, intelligence, spying, and police apparatus, and the surface state, which is the Knesset, general Israeli politics, and the ministries. The deep state is opposed to a religious Zionist Israel, and oppose Netanyahu vehemently. Netanyahu needed this strike more than anything in the world, and he'll be beating the war drum all throughout this upcoming cabinet meeting. Don't expect Israel to play it nice with Iran. Netanyahu won't allow it- he wants this war.",2024-04-14 11:57:12+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/8691,,,7370,0,81,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It carries a very strong symbolic meaning, as it is believed this night will determine the world's destiny for the year to come. In 2017, the IRGC Aerospace Force carried out 'Operation Laylatul Qadr' on this exact night, targeting ISIS strongholds in Syria with a large-scale missile attack, killing over 170 terrorists.

msg_iteration.14658.user.rnintel.post.8101,1810182217,rnintel,8101,,"🇷🇸🇽🇰🇧🇦 - Something important to understand about the situation in the Balkan is that pro-Western actors in the Balkan have an hegemonic agenda. For many Western observers, having ""authoritarian""/BRICS-friendly governments in Belgrade and Banja Luka is something that is avoidable. Especially as an undeclared Cold War 2 is now a thing. Why? Serbia is surrounded by NATO member states. This may not always be the case depending on how Ukraine war ends. So what did the West do? First of all, its important to understand that the Kurti government is a highly nationalist govt. There were multiple status quo in the Northern parts of Kosovo, such as car license plates being Serbian, Serbian presidential elections being held out there, and also the use of the Serbian dinar, and Kurti's policy is to systematically destroy all of those status quo which preceded his government. The West, on its side, doesn't actively supports Kurti's escalatory trajectory, but is ready to protect it. Thus, the West sanctioned Kurti, and spearheaded a ""Ohrid agreement"" which was basically a ""Autonomy for Kosovo's northern Serbs in exchange for normalization deal"", which neither side enforced, as Kosovo repeatedly refused to accept autonomy for its Northern side despite the deal. However, the West reduced its demand for a few hectares of a land to a Serb orthodox monastery, which Kosovo accepted, in exchange for membership in the Council of Europe, a first step before EU membership. Then, about the Dodik govt. Its important to understand that Milorad Dodik, fundamentally, started his career as a pro-Western politician, he came in power by throwing off the wartime-era SDS, and doesn't want the independence of Republika Srpska. He is forced to use independence as a threat because fundamentally Sarajevo doesn't consider the existence of a Serb-majority autonomous entity as legitimate ""Srpska is the result of genocide"" and wants, on the long run, to massively reduce Srprka's autonomy. One way to attack Srpska's autonomy is by cutting off funding to the entity, with the Bosnian Serbs having had long-running financial issues. Thus, Srpska is in a defensive position. The defensive position forced it into some level of defiance, and this defiance enabled the West to launch massive sanctions on the government of Banja Luka. TLDR its obvious that some actors in the West wants to get rid of the governments in Banja Luka and Belgrade by getting them to ""Do something stupid"" which would enable the West to launch crippling sanctions if not military force to throw them off.",2024-03-31 00:40:58+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/8101,,,17202,0,63,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For those unaware of what a red heifer is, it's a Talmudic sacrifice cow. The Jews would sacrifice a red cow, cremate it, and use its ashes for a purification ritual. In the last 3000 years, only 9 red heifers have been sacrificed. In the Jewish tradition, red heifers will be sacrificed in preparation for the reconstruction of the Third Temple and, according to the Jews, the arrival of the Messiah. With the Israeli government cordoning off Al-Aqsas Mosque with a barbed wire fence and ever escalating attacks in the West Bank, it appears they are eyeballing the possibility of bulldozing Al-Aqsas Mosque and constructing the Third Temple. Abu Obaida, the infamous spokesman for the Qassam Brigades, stated that the red heifer purchase in 2022 was one of the primary reasons why Hamas launched Operation Al-Aqsas Flood. While this does not necessarily indicate motive or intention, this is certainly an interesting bit of trivia in the entire Israel-Palestine conflict.

It aims to occupy Southern Lebanon with Jewish settlements. The organization quotes Lt. Col. Ofir Caspi of the Israeli Defense Forces, who stated recently: 'The IDF needs to occupy territory. For me, the only solution (for peace) is to establish Jewish settlements.' Lastly, there is a Torah quote: 'Blow the trumpet in the land of Zion and chant on the Holy Mountain, all the inhabitants of the land will be enraged' The last time a coalition of Zionist organizations openly advocated for Jewish settlements in Lebanon was in the 1980's before the Lebanese civil war. @Middle_East_Spectator",2024-03-28 14:09:29+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/8028,,,3496,0,58,1,PeerChannel,1626824086.0,Middle_East_Spectator,2024-03-28 14:08:58,2024-03-28,https://t.me/Middle_East_Spectator/5625,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Russian security forces clashed with Islamist separatists in Ingushetia during a military operation to quell a terrorist cell. While they may have had affiliation with ISIS, they are far more connected directly to the West and especially to Ukraine. Some Russian sources alleged that the terrorists in Ingushetia were being directly supported by Ukraine, with Ukrainians allegedly giving direct advice to the separatists. If ISIS is involved in this, the extent of their involvement is superficial. The men who attacked the Crocus City Hall were very well-trained and very professional- they fired their weapons in bursts, they had an infil, exfil, and contingency plans, they were well armed, and well-studied on the layout of the building. This attack resembles the apartment bombings of the 90s or the school seizures that Chechen terrorists undertook rather than the ragtag, largely asymmetrical and unplanned behavior of ISIS. In short- Ukrainian involvement cannot be ignored. If the slightest hint of Ukrainian involvement is discovered by Russia, all of Ukraine will burn.",2024-03-22 21:48:37+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/7882,,,7657,0,98,0,,,,,,,1,7880.0,https://t.me/rnintel/7880,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Russia may also find it more difficult to expand into the Sahel and other regions of Africa, as anti-Western regimes may be less likely to trust Russian forces, such as PMC Wagner, with their security. A defeat for Russia in Ukraine means a defeat for Russia worldwide, and likewise for France. If the West fails in repulsing Russia from Eastern Ukraine, anti-French forces in the Sahel and elsewhere may become emboldened to break away from Paris. France has been the black sheep of Europe since the end of the Second World War. It has often chafed under the Anglo-dominated liberal world order, seeking still to assert itself as a global power. At this current time, France will need to find a way to bring the other powerful European states, most importantly Germany and Poland, in line with its vision of Strategic Autonomy. If it can successfully do so, and if the United States fully commits to its Asian pivot, likely under a future Trump administration, the Macronian vision of a Europe led by France may in fact become a reality, and with it one of the largest geopolitical developments of the 21st century.",2024-03-16 02:23:15+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/7718,,,4132,0,32,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msg_iteration.15022.user.rnintel.post.7717,1810182217,rnintel,7717,,"But what exactly would Strategic Autonomy look like? In a world where European defense and security lies on the backburner for the United States, Strategic Autonomy could look like a French led NATO alliance focused primarily on countering any threats emanating from Russia and rolling back its influence in Europe. A EURO-NATO bloc, merging both European Union and NATO membership, could potentially emerge, with the United States playing a formal role as a historically important member, if at all. Strategic Autonomy would not necessarily be a negative development for the regime in Washington. Threatened by both China and Russia, and finding itself unable to deal with both threats at the same time to their fullest extent, passing off European defense to its strongest ally will allow it to complete its pivot to East Asia whilst being sure Russia will not be unchecked in Eastern Europe. France and Russia: Global Competitors What may go unnoticed in recent discussions surrounding France and its foreign policy is the ongoing diplomatic conflict between France and Russia in the Sahel. Following the Second World War, France found itself in a weakened position and as such, began to grant independence to its African and Asian colonies. In Western Africa, this process was conducted mostly peacefully, and as such France maintained close ties to the newly independent African governments. These ties have remained until the current day, however in recent times some of these nations, referred to as the Francafrique, have experienced pro-Russian coups. Specifically, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger have all cut ties with France and the other pro-French African governments in favor of Moscow. All three nations have withdrawn from the G5 Sahel, a military alliance which worked closely with France during Operation Barkhane, France’s counterinsurgency operation against Al-Qaeda in the region. More recently, the three nations have declared their intention to withdraw from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), an economic organization dedicated to the economic integration and cooperation between its 15 member states. Russian support for the coup governments began to pick up during the 2023 Niger coup. Previously, Mali and Burkina Faso’s coups had been staged relatively independently of foreign intervention, with Russian military advisors and personnel entering the countries after French forces had left. In 2023, however, Russia was more willing to openly support the coup attempt, with officials like Dmitry Peskov and Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prighozin proclaiming it a victory for anti-Western, anti-colonial efforts. Protestors could be seen voicing support for Wagner and flying Russian flags. When military intervention into the three countries was floated in 2023, Niger invited Wagner forces into the country, essentially acting as a guarantee against ECOWAS’ threats. Tying it Together One may wonder what this African theater has to do with the war in Ukraine and France’s EURO-NATO ambitions. For France, the Sahel region is a key interest given its richness in strategic resources. Niger is the seventh largest producer of uranium and an exporter of natural gas, much of which powers France. Mali sits on potentially one of the largest lithium deposits in the world, being crucial to the future production of electric vehicles. Guinea is the world’s second largest bauxite producer, a material necessary in alumina production. To France, Russia’s growing influence in the region is depriving it of energy sources and strategic resources, and if its influence grows unchecked, France could find itself locked out of this resource rich region.",2024-03-16 02:23:15+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/7717,,,3660,0,26,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msg_iteration.15023.user.rnintel.post.7716,1810182217,rnintel,7716,,"🇫🇷🇪🇺 - Macron, Strategic Autonomy and European Security by Rerum Novarum Staff Earlier this year, support for continued Ukrainian aid began to falter within the halls of the United States Congress. A bipartisan aid package was shot down by Republican congressmen in the Senate, meaning that for the foreseeable future Ukraine’s war effort will be devoid of much needed materiel support from the United States. Whilst marking a significant shift in the policy of the United States regarding the war, it also has prompted Europe to take its defense and security more seriously. Specifically Emmanuel Macron, the President of France, has recently declared that France can and will consider deploying troops to Ukraine if the situation becomes dire enough. This declaration is a radical departure from NATO’s position on the conflict, which is to provide materiel support to Ukraine, whilst falling short of actually deploying their military forces. Macron’s declaration has been met with mixed reactions from other European leaders, notably condemnation from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Some have begun to speculate about the destiny of the NATO alliance, as well as the changing relationship between the United States and its European allies. America’s Emerging Pivot East The great power competition between the United States and China has been accelerating in recent years, due in no small part to the Trump administration and its focus on confronting China. The change in American policy towards China, from one of tacit assistance and mutual benefit to one of competition and adversarialism, was generally initiated under the Obama administration and its 2012 Pivot to East Asia policy, seeking to strengthen the position of the United States in East Asia by shoring up its alliances and strategic partnerships, specifically with those nations which border China. In the Trump administration Elbridge Colby, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense and Force Development, was instrumental in focusing Trump’s foreign policy on confronting China. Described as a realist, Colby believes the United States should settle its ongoing conflicts in Europe and Middle East to ensure it can fully commit to containing the threat from China. Other high profile figures, such as Tucker Carlson and Vivek Ramaswamy, have supported this position. The 2024 election, therefore, could actually make a difference in a field of policy which enjoys high rates of bipartisan agreement. A Trump administration will likely seek to establish a peace deal with Russia on behalf of Ukraine, cutting whatever losses it deems necessary in order to complete its eastward pivot. These interests clearly conflict with those of France, with Macron stating on French television that under no circumstances is a Russian victory acceptable, instead being an existential crisis to European security. He is also of the belief that Europe alone can guarantee its security, attempting to fill a potential void left by the United States with his vision of Strategic Autonomy. European Strategic Autonomy Macron’s recent statement is not a one-off comment or isolated incident. Quite to the contrary, Macron has been vocal about European “Strategic Autonomy”, meaning the ability for Europe to make decisions regarding its security and foreign policy independently of the United States. The French President first began to articulate his vision of Strategic Autonomy in 2017, drawing on an idea which has been debated in French foreign policy circles since the early 1990’s. He generated controversy by using the term to distance France, and by extension Europe, from the brewing conflict in the South China Sea between Taiwan and China, citing the fact that Europe is an ally, not a vassal, of the United States.",2024-03-16 02:23:14+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/7716,,,3624,0,28,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approval of the plans does not necessarily mean that it will happen any time soon, but simply that the operational plans have been approved, in case the green light is given at any point. 2. Hamas has reportedly done a new ceasefire deal proposal, and the messaging regarding action in Rafah might be Israel's way to pressure Hamas into accepting a deal, signaling that a deal may not be a possibility for much longer. 3. The United States likely wants to finish constructing its artificial port in Gaza before any Israeli invasion of Rafah takes place. 4. The IDF currently does not have enough forces concentrated near Rafah to mount an offensive in the immediate timeframe. 5. Egypt will likely take strong diplomatic actions of protest, considering that Rafah is part of a no-go zone for the IDF according to the 1979 Camp David Accords. @Middle_East_Spectator",2024-03-15 21:02:36+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/7714,,,3045,0,10,1,PeerChannel,1626824086.0,Middle_East_Spectator,2024-03-15 13:31:07,2024-03-15,https://t.me/Middle_East_Spectator/5455,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The appearance of the CL-650 in this zone is quite a unique event, since it usually operates along the northeastern borders of Serbia. This happened almost every day before and during the mass protests in Belgrade just over a month ago. This may be a reaction of the U.S to President Milorad Dodik’s visit to Kazan as part of the provocations they are preparing, and to the situation in Serbian Kosovo. In recent days, the so-called “authorities” of Kosovo have been talking about increased activity of Serbian troops on the border. To some extent, they are right: two major exercises were held in Serbia in two weeks.

msg_iteration.15617.user.rnintel.post.7095,1810182217,rnintel,7095,,"🇷🇺🇺🇦 - Russian targeted strikes have been increasing over the last few months, and there's a very clear pattern emerging, especially looking into recent history. On February 20th, 2014, while the Ukrainian government was being overthrown in an American-backed coup, Russia began its occupation and subsequent annexation of Crimea. In this region, winter tends to end between February 20th and March 5th, creating an environment known as ""peak freeze,"" perfect for Russia's armored doctrine and military maneuverability. On February 24th, 2022, Russia began its special military operation into Ukraine, also occurring when peak freeze was achieved, although the operation was possibly delayed by the Beijing Olympics at the time. From early February 2023 to May 2023, Russia successfully seized control of multiple important cities in the Donbass, including Artemivsk and Soledar, eliminating a major Ukrainian bastion in the Donbass and an important logistics hub for Ukrainian defenses routing into the Donbass. A pattern should be noticeable at this point- Russian military operations coincide with the end of winter and the achievement of ""peak freeze"" in the region. We're currently approaching peak freeze, and as we've extensively written on this channel, a Russian offensive towards Kharkov is to be expected this spring. We've already witnessed light offensives in the Kharkov oblast, most notably Russia regaining a good amount of lost ground towards the city of Kupyansk, even reaching the outskirts of the city. The repeated shellings, missile barrages, and strikes that have been taking place in Ukraine can be best described as ""shaping operations,"" preparing the way for Russia to begin a renewed offensive towards Ukraine's 2nd largest city, and possibly cutting down the Donbass cauldron, where the bulk of Ukraine's military is stationed. In the estimation of the Admin, military operations against Kharkov, Kupyansk, and other cities in the Kharkov oblast could begin between February 20th and March 5th, however Russia may wait until the city of Avdiivka has fallen.",2024-02-07 12:38:31+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/7095,,,4591,0,23,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

America is having to use more of its shrinking stockpile of weapons on Yemen or give them to Israel, which is starting to display how overextended the United States is. Patriot missile system interceptors, for example, are a crucial weapon in America’s, Ukraine’s, and Israel’s air defense. However, because of stockpile issues, someone will get their supply cut off. Beginning on the night of December 28th, Russia launched one of the biggest and most prolonged missile strikes on Ukraine at a scale not seen since the beginning of the war. They started with Geran FPV drones to exhaust Ukrainian air defenses, followed by Iskanders, “Daggers,” Kh-22s, and many more types of Russian missiles of both super and hypersonic qualities, totaling over 160 projectiles in a single night. Again, on January 1st, over 100 missiles were launched. On the 7th and 13th, there were more similarly sized strikes. Besides the large strikes, there was a notable increase in the number of missiles Russia fires daily on average, rising from 5 to 10-20. The Ukrainians, who are always delighted to post any missile interception they get, were quiet, despite making up 95% of interception numbers as usual. Furthermore, the size of the strikes was so large that despite laws in place banning the recording of Russian missile strikes in Ukraine, dozens of videos were posted during the following days of large strikes. There was a noticeable lack of large missile attacks in the months before this strike as Russia spent time stockpiling months in advance. Because of the stockpiling, as mentioned earlier, it displays that these strikes were planned months in advance, hinting that these could be preludes to a sizeable Russian ground offensive in early 2024, likely towards Kharkov in the spring. These attacks will not be the end of missile strikes over Ukraine, but they display the cracks in Ukraine’s war machine as their last remaining AD stockpiles have dried up. Ukraine already has problems replacing other critical war equipment from ongoing fighting and failed offensives across the frontlines. These airstrikes are far from the decisive blow needed to end the war; however, they highlight that as the United States becomes more distracted, the outlook for the future of Ukraine becomes dimmer.",2024-01-23 02:27:50+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/6822,,,3866,0,15,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.15901.user.rnintel.post.6805,1810182217,rnintel,6805,,"🇺🇸🇾🇪 - The Biden Administration has completely failed in every conceivable measure on its foreign policy, and Yemen is just the recent pet project turned disaster. Biden kicked off his administration very early on with an attempt to cool off the Yemeni Civil War by removing Ansar Allah, the Houthis, from the United States' foreign terrorist organization list, reversing President Trump's last minute designation in early January 2021. This ultimately culminated in a ceasefire being put on paper between Ansar Allah and the Presidential Leadership Council in April 2022. Despite the fact that the ceasefire expired in October 2023, the ceasefire has - for the most part - remained in place. Yemen's civil war has resulted in the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, largely thanks to American-supported, Saudi-led airstrikes across Houthi-controlled territory, and America's reversal of this policy in favor of mediation and peace talks initially emerged as a massive victory for the Biden administration. In some ways, one could interpret America's softening policy towards Yemen throughout the course of 2021-2023 as steps towards ending the civil war, even favoring the Houthis in a post-war scenario. However, this all went down the drain when October 7th happened. The United States went from hating the Houthis, to softening its policy towards it, to mediating peace between the Houthis and its enemies, and now a complete 180, carrying out frequent airstrikes against them. What was once a victory - albeit minor in the grand scheme of things - has collapsed. This failure is now intermingled with multiple other foreign policy disasters, not just with the Middle East, but with other regions. Saudi-Israeli peace talks have been indefinitely suspended. The India Middle East Economic Corridor (IMEC) is now in serious jeopardy. The Biden Administration's previous attempts to restart negotiations with Iran on its nuclear program are gone, likely never to return. All of this, coupled with America's failures in Ukraine and the as of now disastrous ""Pivot to Asia"" policy, has pulled the rug from underneath Biden's chances of having just one foreign policy victory in his term. Domestically, Biden will find it impossible to champion a foreign policy victory in the 2024 election. Internationally, America's credibility, respect, and trust has been seriously damaged, and the next administration will have a hard time recuperating America back to where it once was on the world stage.",2024-01-21 12:07:14+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/6805,,,5743,0,28,0,,,,,,,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to Whelan, he feels abandoned and betrayed by his country, which shows no desire to exchange him. ◾️ According to Paul, he has already been repeatedly removed from prisoner exchange lists — while the Russian side is interested in reaching an agreement with Washington on Whelan's issue. ◾️ The current situation — or, more precisely, the behavior of the American authorities — cannot but cause bewilderment. The unwillingness to exchange and rescue their compatriot is surprising, both from the point of view of humanity and politics. ◾️ And while everything is more or less clear with the former, the latter is not clear at all. Whelan's case could become a loud and noticeable PR move before the presidential elections in the United States and help the current administration to earn additional points in the eyes of the electorate.

msg_iteration.16520.user.rnintel.post.6154,1810182217,rnintel,6154,,"Everything reported so far about the chief suspect in the spree stabbing in Dublin on Thursday: 🔹 He was once subject of a deportation order. The man, originally from Algeria, was first arrested in 2003. However, after a judicial review in the High Court his deportation order was revoked. 🔹 In 2008 the Department of Justice granted him leave to stay in Ireland. One source said: “He was due to be deported 20 years ago, but fought the order for five years. He eventually obtained an Irish passport. He is a naturalised Irish citizen.” 🔹 The Daily Mail/Extra report he's in his late 40s while the London Times reports he's in his 50s. 🔹 Detectives have established he loitered around a back gate to Gaelscoil Cholaiste Mhuire on Dublin’s Parnell Square East for around 10 minutes on Thursday – and then to the front before carrying out the shocking attack. 🔹 He watched as a group of children (aged 5 to 6) lined up at the entrance to the school for a minute before pouncing, stabbing a five-year-old girl first and then attacking a school worker who went to save her. He then turned to attack two more children before he was overpowered by several passersby. 🔹 It is understood that the man has no connection to the school, its staff, or the pupils. 🔹 Gardaí are still trying to establish a motive for the attack but do not suspect a terror link. They believe at this stage the he has serious mental health issues. 🔹 A family member of the suspect contacted gardaí hours after Thursday’s attack to tell them he had been a normal man until he suffered a brain tumour two years ago. 🔹 The frantic family member said the man started to suffer from acute mental health problems after the brain tumour – and his life spiralled out of control. 🔹 He has no criminal convictions but has come to Garda attention several times in the past year. The latest incident involved possession of a knife, as well as criminal damage to a car. 🔹 He appeared in Dublin District Court in May over the incidents. The judge in the case heard all the evidence, but made no order. That means he was not convicted of any offence. 🔹 A no-order decision is usually made when a judge rules that there was a significant mental health aspect to the case. 🔹 One source said: ""It is not accurate to say that this man was constantly causing trouble but he was known to officers in the area since those incidents in May."" 🔹 He was living in Dublin City Council hostel accommodation in the inner city before he went on the rampage and gardaí searched that property yesterday for clues, seizing a mobile phone and a laptop connected to the suspect. He had another address before that on the south side of the city. 🔹 He remains in hospital after he was tackled to the ground and subdued by passers-by. Officers are guarding him. 🔹 As soon as he is medically fit, sources have said that detectives from Store Street would arrest him on suspicion of the attempted murder of five people. 🔗 extra.ie 🔗 irishmirror.ie 🔗 archive.is 👉🏻 join Late Stage Ireland",2023-11-26 08:43:35+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/6154,,,4609,0,24,1,PeerChannel,1314940146.0,OrlaredChan,2023-11-26 08:41:01,2023-11-26,https://t.me/OrlaredChan/8944,0,,,1,MessageMediaWebPage,1,https://extra.ie/2023/11/25/news/irish-news/parnell-square-attack-suspect,extra.ie,Parnell Square Stabbing Attack: Suspect Had Been Arrested Earlier This Year,Sources have told this newspaper that the man was living in Dublin City Council hostel accommodation before he went on the rampage off Parnell Square on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msg_iteration.16533.user.rnintel.post.6140,1810182217,rnintel,6140,,"🇦🇷 🇮🇱 💵 NatCon, Chabad, Libertarianism: The Javier Milei Convergence 🔶️ As for Milei’s strong belief in and defense of Judaism, one of his first announced actions as Argentine President will be to move the Argentine embassy to Jerusalem7, a move many have remarked resembles that of President Trump. Also announced was that his first diplomatic trip will be to Israel to ensure warm and secure relations. 🔶️ You may have seen various online rightwing influencers celebrating Milei’s victory as a victory for the “global populist movement”. There has been a persistent, and without a doubt malicious, alignment and conflation of the nationalist revival in the United States with other parties, movements, or ideas across the globe. One may recall Steve Bannon’s idea of building up global infrastructure for a worldwide nationalist movement9, or perhaps even his Academy for the Judeo-Christian West, the academic institution which would create these national-populist elites. It is important to realize that there is a common theme amongst the parties or people this rapidly-organizing sphere promotes: they are all Zionists. Whether it is Giorgia Meloni in Italy, Victor Orban in Hungary, Nayib Bukele in El Salvador, or now Javier Milei in Argentina, all of the figures promoted by this new populist influencer sphere are avowed Zionists – and when these figures assume power, the situation for their respective nations almost invariably declines. Presented in a different way: Why exactly would Javier Milei be on friendly terms with Nayib Bukele? Bukele has used state power to crush his enemies and subdue El Salvador, something Milei would ostensibly strongly oppose. Zionism is the chain which binds these figures together. 🔶️ What, then, do these developments amount to? It is clear that Javier Milei serves not the interests nor the people of Argentina. Milei will be used as a puppet of the Likud party and of its proxies in the American government to further Zionist political influence over the globe. Milei’s classical liberalism will ensure that the Argentine state is severely weakened, inviting in hostile foreign elements in its stead. The destruction of the Central Bank will create an economic power vacuum, ready to be filled by whatever actors those in American finance have ready for it. His privatization of key public assets ensures Argentina’s resources will fall prey to Silicon Valley private investors, all too keen to expand the reach of their influence. These same NatCon influencers will use this victory to attempt to prop up some Milei-esque political figure in the United States in a future congressional election in an effort to build up what amounts to a NatCon World Order. The United States will benefit from dislodging Chinese and Russian investments in the country, as Milei will be happy to shirk deals with these nations in favor of the United States and Israel. And to top it all off, Javier Milei will be converting to Judaism, symbolic of the transformation which he will undertake for the nation at large. It is beyond clear that Javier Milei is an anti-nationalist subversive used by the current Anglo-American world order to further their interests in this corner of the globe. 🔽 Continued https://americanbookclub.org/natcon-chabad-libertarianism-the-javier-milei-convergence/",2023-11-24 00:44:08+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/6140,,,4347,0,46,1,PeerChannel,1458480018.0,CIG_telegram,2023-11-23 18:23:07,2023-11-23,https://t.me/CIG_telegram/39758,0,,,1,MessageMediaWebPage,1,https://americanbookclub.org/natcon-chabad-libertarianism-the-javier-milei-convergence/,americanbookclub.org,"NatCon, Chabad, Libertarianism: The Javier Milei Convergence","With the election of Javier Milei, it appears the paranoia of the Junta generals was not unfounded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Milei's proposals to attach Argentina to the U.S. Dollar, cut off integrations with BRICS, and unconditionally support Israel are not positions of a pro-Argentina candidate- those are ideals of an American-backed ""banana Republic"" type candidate. None of this is to mention the fact that Milei is converting to Judaism. According to the man himself, Javier Milei reads the Torah daily and visits a Chabad rabbi every week. When asked if he was converting to Judaism, Milei stated his only reservations about converting to Judaism would be questions about ""who would be president on the Sabbath?"" In addition to this, Milei has blasted the Catholic Church, including Pope Francis - a native of Argentina - calling him a ""communist"" and blaspheming him with the same vitriol that anti-Catholic pundits harbor towards Pope Francis. By no means is Milei ""based"" or ""our guy-"" he's quite the opposite.

They say that these mass demonstrations in support of Palestine are identical to the BLM protests and they are motivated by an analogous grievance against “oppressor.” (There are glaring flaws in these comparisons.) It is pretty transparent that the Zionists are pushing American conservatives to identify Israel’s problems with their own problems only so that they will rally behind the cause of Israel. Pitiful conservatives imagine that this is reciprocated by Jews who have finally realized the threat posed by BLM to “the West.” Obvious influence-agents like Costin Alamariu’s network have encouraged White Nationalists to self-consciously embrace this psyop for pragmatic reasons: that “we” can “use” the power of the wrathful Zionist machine for our ends— to defund Left Wing universities, deport immigrants, or divide the political Left, all in the name of “battling Hamas.” The benefits of this are being shamelessly oversold, as is always the case with these political scams. There will be no mass deportations, the Ivy Leagues will not be defunded, and the political Left (including Jews) will rally against Whites once again. All that will happen is that the most radical supporters of the Palestinian cause will be isolated and punished. Or to put it another way— all that will happen is precisely what will benefit the Jews and nothing more. Or are people seriously under the impression that Jews will lose track keeping score and accidentally help White people?

I think the more effective strategy is to exploit the contradictions within the American Right by highlighting the un-Christian treatment of Palestinians by Israelis and the lunatic war-mongering by American Zionists. We can see the latter playing out as gentiles like Charlie Kirk and Alex Jones chafe at accusations of antisemitism for highlighting the peculiarity of the “security failure” on October 7th. Or with the simmering tension at DailyWire between gentiles Candace Owens and Matt Walsh, and the Jews Ben Shapiro and Andrew Klavan. This is also building on the success of “BanTheADL” as conservatives become cognizant of Jewish influence on the Left and Right, from both Soros and Netanyahu. The key distinction between these strategies is that the conflict between Left Wing Jewry and BLM will result in a victory for the Jews. Capitulation by Harvard, UPenn, and Columbia last week are an example of this. On the other hand, the emergent conflict between Right Wing Zionists and America First gentiles results in a victory for Americans as consciousness of Zionist influence rises… 🤔",2023-11-14 15:28:32+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/5957,,,2739,0,11,1,PeerChannel,1343341889.0,nickjfuentes,2023-11-14 14:43:08,2023-11-14,https://t.me/nickjfuentes/12114,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Catholic Church always has and continues to maintain that transsexualism is innately disordered and sinful. By no means has the Church decided that it is now okay- this is completely false. The purpose of the sacraments, from a very oversimplified and basic understanding, is to heal broken people. By allowing transsexuals to be baptized, the purpose is to introduce the sacrament of baptism to a disordered person in hopes that they turn from their sin and end their disordered practice. In spite of all the anti-Catholic comments spread online regarding this release, the Church's position on sexual degeneracy remains unchanged and will always remain unchanged.

Immigrants have been pouring in and the universities and media have promulgated anti-white hatred for decades. But now that Israel is under attack, suddenly there is an urgency and the political will to expel “pro-Hamas” immigrants and choke universities that stage any “pro-Hamas” support. Clearly this is not the beginning of any kind of “solution” or awakening to these long-term problems, this is a hasty gambit to trick gullible conservatives into attacking Israel’s opposition in America and Europe. This is critical since Israel relies totally on sustained, unconditional American support to deter an attack from Iran as it conducts its operations in Gaza. Thus, the Zionists have engineered a conservative movement in which the mainstream explicitly supports Israel completely, and the “controlled opposition” implicitly supports Israel by attacking its enemies. Regardless— even those that consider refugees the most pressing threat must realize that Israel’s unrestrained aggression in Gaza will create more refugees.

As we remember, when Elon Musk acquired Twitter in late 2022, the Anti-Defamation League organized a massive advertiser boycott against Twitter, coinciding with Kanye West's antics at the time. This resulted in Musk going on the defense with regards to his decision-making, ultimately making way for him to concede to the demands of these various Jewish groups. In addition to this, Musk has been attacked for his distribution, or lack thereof, of Starlink itself. Musk withdrew Ukraine's access to Starlink in the Crimea Peninsula, citing geopolitical risks with his technology being used to attack Russian naval assets, which consequently put him on the defense against his detractors. We can expect a similar outcome in the next few weeks with regards to Gaza.

There are several theories that I'm seeing around, and I would like to state them for the sake of honesty. 1- Israel purposefully targeted it with the permission of Israeli high command, to either 1) See how the Egyptians would react to a slight escalation, in case Israel wishes to evict the Gazans purposefully across to Sinai 2) Drag Egypt into a war, considering Egypt is the only neighbor of Israel that has the manpower, equipment, and experience to fight a prolonged conventional, therefore solidifying American presence and forcing America to the war to protect Israel, a ""New U.S.S Liberty"" per say 2- The Israeli tank crew did this on their own perogative, three Israeli tourists were shot dead by an Egyptian Conscript in the Police, and before that three IDF soldiers were killed by an Egyptian soldier, therefore their emotions most likely were running high and did this independently. 3- The Israelis are trying to close the Rafah border crossing, and this was a message The one thing of interest I would note is that suddenly, most of the opposition that was complaining that Egypt is being dragged into a war and that we should not mobilize more than the second and third army are now calling for war, fifth column or lowlifes?

msg_iteration.18199.user.rnintel.post.4392,1810182217,rnintel,4392,,"❗️🇮🇱🇵🇸 Aggravation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone what is known as of 14.00 October 7, 2023 Since eight in the morning, another round of escalation in the conflict zone has continued: the stakes continue to be raised, calling what is happening a full-fledged war, which should put an end to the conflict. ▪️ Palestinian forces still maintain a presence in settlements neighboring the Gaza Strip. More and more footage of killed and wounded, as well as captured Israelis, both from security forces and civilians, is appearing on the Internet. ▪️ Sabotage groups of the “Sakr” unit penetrated into certain settlements by sea and air, landing troops. They were most likely joined by local sleeper cells. The contingent participating in the events is very modest in size and causes more panic than actually engages in combat operations. There is information about the release of prisoners from prisons, but there is no evidence yet. ▪️ South of Ashkelon, the Rutenberg power plant was hit. A fire broke out at the facility. ▪️ Hostages were taken in Ofakim, and in Jerusalem there was the first knife attack and arson of a police station in the Jebel Mukaeber area. ▪️ Israel's Minister of National Security declared a state of emergency throughout the country. Recruitment of volunteers for law enforcement agencies has begun. ▪️ The IDF press service announced strikes on 21 Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip. ▪️ The Ministry of Health announced 545 wounded Israelis (judging by the density of shelling and the number of videos with victims, the actual number of killed and wounded Israelis exceeded a thousand ). It seems that informal talks have begun regarding the prisoners. 🔻Given the demands to start an “intifada” and the much larger scale of hostilities than in previous years, most likely we are only seeing the beginning of the Marlezon ballet, and the most interesting things are yet to come.

(Qur'an) Hezbollah congratulates the nation and the Palestinian resistance and the Mujahideen of the heroic factions of Palestine, especially the dear brothers in the Qassam Battalions and the Islamic Resistance Movement of Hamas, for this extensive and heroic operation. This victorious operation is a decisive response to the continuous crimes of the occupation and the continuous attack on the sanctuaries, honor and dignity. It is a new confirmation that the will of the Palestinian nation and the weapon of resistance is the only option against aggression and occupation, and a message to the Arab and Islamic world and the international community, especially those seeking normalization. The Palestinian issue is a living issue that will not die until victory and liberation. We ask the people of the Arab and Islamic nations and the free people of the world to declare their support for the Palestinian people and the movements that confirm their unity in blood, word and deed. The leadership of the Islamic resistance of Lebanon is closely monitoring the important developments of the Palestinian scene and follows the field conditions with great interest and is in direct contact with the leadership of the Palestinian resistance, inside and outside, and maintains continuous communication with it. We are evaluating the events and the manner of carrying out the operations, and therefore, we ask the Zionist enemy government to understand the important lessons that the Palestinian resistance has taught to the field and arenas of confrontation and combat. @Middle_East_Spectator",2023-10-07 12:19:17+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/4382,,,1799,0,18,1,PeerChannel,1626824086.0,Middle_East_Spectator,2023-10-07 12:18:51,2023-10-07,https://t.me/Middle_East_Spectator/1681,0,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This makes it harder for the Shahed to be intercepted and shot down. Due to having a jet engine, this new variant has slightly less range and payload than its propellor-powered predecessor. Some have called it a 'stealth' version of the Shahed-136, due to it no longer having the iconic buzzing sound which made it easy to identify. @Middle_East_Spectator",2023-09-26 17:08:39+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/4239,,,2114,0,15,1,PeerChannel,1626824086.0,Middle_East_Spectator,2023-09-26 13:26:20,2023-09-26,https://t.me/Middle_East_Spectator/1551,0,,,1,MessageMediaDocument,0,,,,,video/mp4,5.80786125820396e+18,6.397,IMG_8925.MP4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A nationalist group contacted us to publish a story about the Chisinau Pride parade from last June. The guys at Comunitatea Identitară wrote of a group of pro-Romanian, Moldovan nationalists gathered for a peaceful counter manifestation to the pride parade carrying a banner with a slogan in in favor of the protection of the family and a few flags without any political affiliation as such slogans are typically used by the pro-Russian opposition. Before they were able to do anything, a policeman came, asked about their plans, IDed them, took pictures of their props, called in for backup reporting that ""a suspect group is targeting the parade"" and were quickly ushered into police cars and went to the nearest station for more IDing. The policemen said they support their messaging but ""they have orders"" and were thus powerless to not detaining them. Yet the cops would confiscate the banner and the flags despite Moldovan law not prohibiting the display of such props at a public manifestation. The group which asked to remain anonymous, was then accused of organising protests through a Telegram groupchat and the police asked for the identity of the groupchat owner. By the time they were released, with no charges or fines, the parade had ended and their chance to show their disagreement with it was gone. The Chisinau Pride Parade featured a number of significant public figures among which but not limited to, PAS MP, Eugeniu Sinchevici and American ambassador to Moldova, Kent Logsdon. While PAS is not explicitly pro LGBT, it has LGBT activists among its ranks, like Marcela Nistor, the VP of PAS's youth organisation.

According to a statement released by the Ukrainian Embassy in Israel, the Ukrainian government sent a ""clear message"" to Tel Aviv, warning that ""if the deportation of Ukrainians from Israel is not stopped,"" Kiev will suspend the visa agreement, and it will prohibit thousands of Jewish pilgrims from travelling to the Ukrainian city of Uman, where the tomb of Rabbi Nachman of Breslev, leader of the Hasidic religious movement, is located. ""The Ukrainian government will not tolerate the humiliation of its citizens by entering Israel,"" said the Ukrainian ambassador to Israel, Yevgeny Korniychuk, adding that ""it is unthinkable"" that the Ukrainian side ""would have to make a great effort to accommodate dozens of thousands of Israelis in Uman, with a high security risk, and with a huge logistical effort, when, on the other hand, the Israeli government abuses the Ukrainian citizens who come to Israel under the treaty between both countries"". For his part, the Minister of the Interior and Health, Moshe Arbel, rejected Kiev's accusations. ""Israel's immigration policy welcomes tourists from many countries around the world, including Ukrainians. In cases where there is a suspicion that they are using their tourist visa illegally to work or settle, the Population, Immigration and Border Authority acts in accordance with its legal authority,"" he said. 🔴 @DDGeopolitics",2023-08-21 13:39:05+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/3626,,,2239,0,15,1,PeerChannel,1676275372.0,DDGeopolitics,2023-08-21 13:35:29,2023-08-21,https://t.me/DDGeopolitics/78103,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The people requesting the services of the girls were mainly Arabs from Bahrain and the surrounding countries but also American officers from the US Navy's 5th Fleet which is stationed in Manama, the capital of Bahrain. The girls, aged between 13 and 17 years old were lured to the country by a group of Russian citizens which would seize their passports and other IDs to prevent them from escaping the country and then handing them over to their Bahraini partners. The ring is active since at least 2013 and at least one girl died due to physical trauma at the hands of one of the abusers after trying to escape the hotel where she was housed in. They were sold to clients for between 7000 to 14.000 USD. The journalists, which worked undercover, also found out that a lot of the girls got pregnant and were forced to carry out abortion late into the pregnancy with some giving birth to dead fetuses which would end up thrown into garbage bins.

A Journalist who belongs to an allegedly neutral but publicly thought to be a Muslim Brotherhood founded journal on Twitter and Facebook and other mass media has two posts it published deleted, then they posted a photo saying their staff and sites are under cyber attacks. Then, they come with some 6 tweet long post stating that one of their most active journalists has been arrested, the story goes that masked men came to their home, trashed it, stole his phone, kidnapped him, and now no one knows where he is. The journal is shocked because it stated, by its own admission, that the identity of the journalists and the staff were kept a secret, yet now their journalists and staff are being hunted down like dogs in Egypt and everyone has went to hiding. Whether they're being funded, are neutral, or the story they published, or the likes, is not of my interest, I am interested in how that information got leaked to the Egyptian government. My educated yet unproven and schizophrenic guess is that Turkey leaked the information to Egypt. The Journal has many associates and even a few related office buildings in Istanbul, and although they claim they never got state fundings, who knows, considering Turkey has been a refugee for Anti Regime figures, they probably thought it's safe to set up shop there. Whether the information was given to Turkish officials (if true) was obtained willingly by cooperation, or surveillance, or any other method, and was then leaked to Egypt, I don't know, there could've been a myriad of ways. But one thing for sure. Anti Regime figures are not safe, not in Turkey, and maybe soon not even in the U.K, it's enough they've detained 50 members of the MB, they've refused to extend the visa or asylum of others, etc...

Basically Elon needs to integrate Twitter into a larger revenue generation infrastructure in order to liberate its business model from dependence upon advertisers - as of last year, 92% of twitter's revenue is from advertising. So long as twitter retains this business model it is vulnerable to advertiser boycotts, if a free speech platform is ever going to become structurally viable as a business model it needs to expand beyond the limitations of just being a social media company. It instead needs to leverage social media use as customer engagement for other more profitable services.

According to her, the goal was to disrupt the logistics of the Russian Federation Armed Forces operating in Ukraine Noteworthy that earlier Ukraine officially denied its responsibility for undermining the bridge, with even some of Ukraine ministers repeatedly implying that it was the work of third parties or even a false flag by Russia itself. The bridge was damaged less than a month after the sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 & Nord stream 2 gas pipelines. As a result of the attack, 3 civilians were killed",2023-07-09 16:21:38+00:00,https://t.me/rnintel/2984,,,1677,0,13,1,PeerChannel,1161666782.0,BellumActaNews,2023-07-09 13:32:41,2023-07-09,https://t.me/BellumActaNews/98990,0,,,1,MessageMediaPhoto,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
